# API & SDK Documentation Collection

This repository serves as a curated collection of SDK (Software Development Kit) and API (Application Programming Interface) documentation. All documents are in Markdown format.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this collection is to provide a structured and easily accessible knowledge base of various development tools and services. These documents can be utilized as contextual information for large language models (LLMs) to enhance their understanding and generation capabilities related to specific APIs or SDKs.

## Structure

Each set of documentation for a specific API or SDK should be organized within its own sub-folder in this repository. It's recommended to maintain a clear and consistent structure within each document for better readability and parsing.

## Documentation Index

Below is an index of the available documentation, along with links to their respective folders and last update times.

| API/SDK Name          | Folder                                      | Last Updated |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Chrome Extensions API | [chrome_extension](./chrome_extension/)     | 2025-05-25   |
| Firefox WebExtensions API | [fireFox_extension](./fireFox_extension/) | 2025-06-20   |
| Jest Testing Framework | [jest](./jest/)                           | Various      |
| VS Code Extension API | [vscode-extension](./vscode-extension/)     | Various      |
| _Another API/SDK_     | [_./path_to_folder/_](./path_to_folder/)    | _YYYY-MM-DD_ |
| _And so on..._        | [_./path_to_another/_](./path_to_another/) | _YYYY-MM-DD_ |

*Please update the "Last Updated" date manually when you modify the contents of a documentation folder.*

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! If you have documentation for an API or SDK that is not yet included:
1. Create a new folder for it.
2. Add your Markdown files to that folder.
3. Add an entry to the "Documentation Index" table in this README, linking to your new folder and specifying the current date as "Last Updated".

Please ensure the documentation is in Markdown format and follows a clear structure.

## Usage

You can clone this repository to have a local copy of all the documentation. The Markdown files can then be used as input or context for various applications, especially those involving large language models that require specific domain knowledge.
