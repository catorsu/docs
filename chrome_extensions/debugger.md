# chrome.debugger

## Description

The `chrome.debugger` API serves as an alternate transport for Chrome's remote debugging protocol. Use `chrome.debugger` to attach to one or more tabs to instrument network interaction, debug JavaScript, mutate the DOM and CSS, and more. Use the `Debuggee` property `tabId` to target tabs with `sendCommand` and route events by `tabId` from `onEvent` callbacks.

## Permissions

`debugger`

You must declare the `"debugger"` permission in your extension's manifest to use this API.

```json
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "debugger"
  ],
  ...
}
```

## Concepts and usage

Once attached, the `chrome.debugger` API lets you send Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) commands to a given target. Explaining the CDP in depth is out of scope for this documentation—to learn more about CDP check out the official CDP documentation.

### Targets

Targets represent something which is being debugged—this could include a tab, an iframe or a worker. Each target is identified by a UUID and has an associated type (such as `iframe`, `shared_worker`, and more).

Within a target, there may be multiple execution contexts—for example same process iframes don't get a unique target but are instead represented as different contexts that can be accessed from a single target.

### Restricted domains

For security reasons, the `chrome.debugger` API does not provide access to all Chrome DevTools Protocol Domains. The available domains are: `Accessibility`, `Audits`, `CacheStorage`, `Console`, `CSS`, `Database`, `Debugger`, `DOM`, `DOMDebugger`, `DOMSnapshot`, `Emulation`, `Fetch`, `IO`, `Input`, `Inspector`, `Log`, `Network`, `Overlay`, `Page`, `Performance`, `Profiler`, `Runtime`, `Storage`, `Target`, `Tracing`, `WebAudio`, and `WebAuthn`.

### Work with frames

There is not a one to one mapping of frames to targets. Within a single tab, multiple same process frames may share the same target but use a different execution context. On the other hand, a new target may be created for an out-of-process iframe.

To attach to all frames, you need to handle each type of frame separately:

*   Listen for the `Runtime.executionContextCreated` event to identify new execution contexts associated with same process frames.
*   Follow the steps to attach to related targets to identify out-of-process frames.

### Attach to related targets

After connecting to a target, you may want to connect to further related targets including out-of-process child frames or associated workers.

Starting in Chrome 125, the `chrome.debugger` API supports flat sessions. This lets you add additional targets as children to your main debugger session and message them without needing another call to `chrome.debugger.attach`. Instead, you can add a `sessionId` property when calling `chrome.debugger.sendCommand` to identify the child target you would like to send a command to.

To automatically attach to out of process child frames, first add a listener for the `Target.attachedToTarget` event:

```javascript
chrome.debugger.onEvent.addListener((source, method, params) => {
  if (method === "Target.attachedToTarget") {
    // `source` identifies the parent session, but we need to construct a new
    // identifier for the child session
    const session = {
      ...source,
      sessionId: params.sessionId
    };
    // Call any needed CDP commands for the child session
    await chrome.debugger.sendCommand(session, "Runtime.enable");
  }
});
```

Then, enable auto attach by sending the `Target.setAutoAttach` command with the `flatten` option set to `true`:

```javascript
await chrome.debugger.sendCommand({ tabId }, "Target.setAutoAttach", {
  autoAttach: true,
  waitForDebuggerOnStart: false,
  flatten: true,
  filter: [{ type: "iframe", exclude: false }]
});
```

Auto-attach only attaches to frames the target is aware of, which is limited to frames which are immediate children of a frame associated with it. For example, with the frame hierarchy A -> B -> C (where all are cross-origin), calling `Target.setAutoAttach` for the target associated with A would result in the session also being attached to B. However, this is not recursive, so `Target.setAutoAttach` also needs to be called for B to attach the session to C.

## Examples

To try this API, install the debugger API example from the `chrome-extension-samples` repository.

## Types

### `Debuggee`

Debuggee identifier. Either `tabId`, `extensionId` or `targetId` must be specified

#### Properties

*   `extensionId`

    `string` optional

    The id of the extension which you intend to debug. Attaching to an extension background page is only possible when the `--silent-debugger-extension-api` command-line switch is used.
*   `tabId`

    `number` optional

    The id of the tab which you intend to debug.
*   `targetId`

    `string` optional

    The opaque id of the debug target.

### `DebuggerSession`

Chrome 125+

Debugger session identifier. One of `tabId`, `extensionId` or `targetId` must be specified. Additionally, an optional `sessionId` can be provided. If `sessionId` is specified for arguments sent from `onEvent`, it means the event is coming from a child protocol session within the root debuggee session. If `sessionId` is specified when passed to `sendCommand`, it targets a child protocol session within the root debuggee session.

#### Properties

*   `extensionId`

    `string` optional

    The id of the extension which you intend to debug. Attaching to an extension background page is only possible when the `--silent-debugger-extension-api` command-line switch is used.
*   `sessionId`

    `string` optional

    The opaque id of the Chrome DevTools Protocol session. Identifies a child session within the root session identified by `tabId`, `extensionId` or `targetId`.
*   `tabId`

    `number` optional

    The id of the tab which you intend to debug.
*   `targetId`

    `string` optional

    The opaque id of the debug target.

### `DetachReason`

Chrome 44+

Connection termination reason.

#### Enum

*   `"target_closed"`
*   `"canceled_by_user"`

### `TargetInfo`

Debug target information

#### Properties

*   `attached`

    `boolean`

    True if debugger is already attached.
*   `extensionId`

    `string` optional

    The extension id, defined if `type` = `'background_page'`.
*   `faviconUrl`

    `string` optional

    Target favicon URL.
*   `id`

    `string`

    Target id.
*   `tabId`

    `number` optional

    The tab id, defined if `type` == `'page'`.
*   `title`

    `string`

    Target page title.
*   `type`

    `TargetInfoType`

    Target type.
*   `url`

    `string`

    Target URL.

### `TargetInfoType`

Chrome 44+

Target type.

#### Enum

*   `"page"`
*   `"background_page"`
*   `"worker"`
*   `"other"`

## Methods

### `attach()`

Promise

```javascript
chrome.debugger.attach(
  target: Debuggee,
  requiredVersion: string,
  callback?: function,
)
```

Attaches debugger to the given target.

#### Parameters

*   `target`

    `Debuggee`

    Debugging target to which you want to attach.
*   `requiredVersion`

    `string`

    Required debugging protocol version (`"0.1"`). One can only attach to the debuggee with matching major version and greater or equal minor version. List of the protocol versions can be obtained here.

    () => void
    ```

#### Returns

*   `Promise<void>`

    Chrome 96+

    Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
