## Methods

### getDeviceAnnotatedLocation()

Promise Chrome 66+

```
chrome.enterprise.deviceAttributes.getDeviceAnnotatedLocation( callback?: function, )
```

Fetches the administrator-annotated Location. If the current user is not affiliated or no Annotated Location has been set by the administrator, returns an empty `string`.

  Promises are supported in `Manifest V3` and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same `function` call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the `callback`.

### getDeviceAssetId()

Promise Chrome 66+
