# chrome.webAuthenticationProxy

## Description

The `chrome.webAuthenticationProxy` API lets remote desktop software running on a remote host intercept Web Authentication API (WebAuthn) requests in order to handle them on a local client.

## Permissions

`webAuthenticationProxy`

Chrome 115+ MV3+

## Types

### `CreateRequest`

  The `PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions` passed to `navigator.credentials.create()`, serialized as a JSON string. The serialization format is compatible with `PublicKeyCredential.parseCreationOptionsFromJSON()`.
* `requestId`

  number

  An opaque identifier for the request.

### `CreateResponseDetails`

#### Properties

  The `requestId` of the `CreateRequest`.
* `responseJson`

  string optional

  The `PublicKeyCredential`, yielded by the remote request, if any, serialized as a JSON string by calling href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#dom-publickeycredential-tojson"> `PublicKeyCredential.toJSON()`.

## Methods

### `attach()`

Promise

```js
chrome.webAuthenticationProxy.attach( callback?: function, )
```

Makes this extension the active Web Authentication API request proxy.

Remote desktop extensions typically call this method after detecting attachment of a remote session to this host. Once this method returns without error, regular processing of WebAuthn requests is suspended, and events from this extension API are raised.

This method fails with an error if a different extension is already attached.

The attached extension must call `detach()` once the remote desktop session has ended in order to resume regular WebAuthn request processing. Extensions automatically become detached if they are unloaded.

Refer to the `onRemoteSessionStateChange` event for signaling a change of remote session attachment from a native application to to the (possibly suspended) extension.

#### Parameters

* `callback`

  function optional

  The callback parameter looks like:

  ```js
  (error?: string) => void
  ```

  + `error`

    string optional

#### Returns

* `Promise<string | undefined>`

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

### `completeCreateRequest()`

Promise

```js
chrome.webAuthenticationProxy.completeCreateRequest( details: CreateResponseDetails, callback?: function, )
```

Reports the result of a `navigator.credentials.create()` call. The extension must call this for every `onCreateRequest` event it has received, unless the request was canceled (in which case, an `onRequestCanceled` event is fired).

#### Parameters

* `details`

  `CreateResponseDetails`
* `callback`

  function optional

  The callback parameter looks like:

  ```js
  () => void
  ```

#### Returns

* `Promise<void>`

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

### `completeGetRequest()`

Promise

```js
chrome.webAuthenticationProxy.completeGetRequest( details: GetResponseDetails, callback?: function, )
```

Reports the result of a `navigator.credentials.get()` call. The extension must call this for every `onGetRequest` event it has received, unless the request was canceled (in which case, an `onRequestCanceled` event is fired).

#### Parameters

* `details`

  `GetResponseDetails`
* `callback`

  function optional

  The callback parameter looks like:

  ```js
  () => void
  ```

#### Returns

* `Promise<void>`

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

### `completeIsUvpaaRequest()`

Promise

```js
chrome.webAuthenticationProxy.completeIsUvpaaRequest( details: IsUvpaaResponseDetails, callback?: function, )
```

Reports the result of a `PublicKeyCredential.isUserVerifyingPlatformAuthenticator()` call. The extension must call this for every `onIsUvpaaRequest` event it has received.

#### Parameters

* `details`

  `IsUvpaaResponseDetails`
* `callback`

  function optional

  The callback parameter looks like:

  ```js
  () => void
  ```

#### Returns

* `Promise<void>`

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

### `detach()`

Promise

```js
chrome.webAuthenticationProxy.detach( callback?: function, )
```

Removes this extension from being the active Web Authentication API request proxy.

This method is typically called when the extension detects that a remote desktop session was terminated. Once this method returns, the extension ceases to be the active Web Authentication API request proxy.

Refer to the `onRemoteSessionStateChange` event for signaling a change of remote session attachment from a native application to to the (possibly suspended) extension.

#### Parameters

* `callback`

  function optional

  The callback parameter looks like:

  ```js
  (error?: string) => void
  ```

  + `error`

    string optional

#### Returns

* `Promise<string | undefined>`

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

## Events

### `onCreateRequest`

```js
chrome.webAuthenticationProxy.onCreateRequest.addListener( callback: function, )
```

Fires when a WebAuthn `navigator.credentials.create()` call occurs. The extension must supply a response by calling `completeCreateRequest()` with the `requestId` from `requestInfo`.

#### Parameters

* `callback`

  function

  The callback parameter looks like:

  ```js
  (requestInfo: CreateRequest) => void
  ```

  + `requestInfo`

    `CreateRequest`

### `onGetRequest`

```js
chrome.webAuthenticationProxy.onGetRequest.addListener( callback: function, )
```

Fires when a WebAuthn `navigator.credentials.get()` call occurs. The extension must supply a response by calling `completeGetRequest()` with the `requestId` from `requestInfo`

#### Parameters

* `callback`

  function

  The callback parameter looks like:

  ```js
  (requestInfo: GetRequest) => void
  ```

  + `requestInfo`

    `GetRequest`

### `onIsUvpaaRequest`

```js
chrome.webAuthenticationProxy.onIsUvpaaRequest.addListener( callback: function, )
```

Fires when a `PublicKeyCredential.isUserVerifyingPlatformAuthenticatorAvailable()` call occurs. The extension must supply a response by calling `completeIsUvpaaRequest()` with the `requestId` from `requestInfo`

#### Parameters

* `callback`

  function

  The callback parameter looks like:

  ```js
  (requestInfo: IsUvpaaRequest) => void
  ```

  + `requestInfo`

    `IsUvpaaRequest`

### `onRemoteSessionStateChange`

```js
chrome.webAuthenticationProxy.onRemoteSessionStateChange.addListener( callback: function, )
```

A native application associated with this extension can cause this event to be fired by writing to a file with a name equal to the extension's ID in a directory named `WebAuthenticationProxyRemoteSessionStateChange` inside the default user data directory

The contents of the file should be empty. I.e., it is not necessary to change the contents of the file in order to trigger this event.

The native host application may use this event mechanism to signal a possible remote session state change (i.e. from detached to attached, or vice versa) while the extension service worker is possibly suspended. In the handler for this event, the extension can call the `attach()` or `detach()` API methods accordingly.

The event listener must be registered synchronously at load time.

#### Parameters

* `callback`

  function

  The callback parameter looks like:

  ```js
  () => void
  ```

### `onRequestCanceled`

```js
chrome.webAuthenticationProxy.onRequestCanceled.addListener( callback: function, )
```

Fires when a `onCreateRequest` or `onGetRequest` event is canceled (because the WebAuthn request was aborted by the caller, or because it timed out). When receiving this event, the extension should cancel processing of the corresponding request on the client side. Extensions cannot complete a request once it has been canceled.

#### Parameters

* `callback`

  function

  The callback parameter looks like:

  ```js
  (requestId: number) => void
  ```

  + `requestId`

    number
