Important: This API works only on ChromeOS.

## Description

Use the `chrome.printing` API to send print jobs to printers installed on Chromebook.

## Permissions

`printing`

## Availability

Chrome 81+ ChromeOS only

All `chrome.printing` methods and events require you to declare the "printing" permission in the extension manifest. For example:

```json
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "printing"
  ],
  ...
}
```

## Examples

The examples below demonstrate using each of the methods in the printing namespace. This code is copied from or based on the api-samples/printing in the extensions-samples Github repo.

### cancelJob()

This example uses the `onJobStatusChanged` handler to hide a 'cancel' button when the `jobStatus` is neither `PENDING` or `IN_PROGRESS`. Note that on some networks or when a Chromebook is connected directly to the printer, these states may pass too quickly for the cancel button to be visible long enough to be called. This is greatly simplified printing example.

```javascript
chrome.printing.onJobStatusChanged.addListener((jobId, status) => {
  const cancelButton = document.getElementById("cancelButton");
  cancelButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    chrome.printing.cancelJob(jobId).then((response) => {
      if (response !== undefined) {
        console.log(response.status);
      }
      if (chrome.runtime.lastError !== undefined) {
        console.log(chrome.runtime.lastError.message);
      }
    });
  });
  if (status !== "PENDING" && status !== "IN_PROGRESS") {
    cancelButton.style.visibility = 'hidden';
  } else {
    cancelButton.style.visibility = 'visible';
  }
});
```

### getPrinters() and getPrinterInfo()

A single example is used for these functions because getting printer information requires a printer ID, which is retrieved by calling `getPrinters()`. This example logs the name and description of the default printer to the console. This is a simplified version of the printing example.

```javascript
const printers = await chrome.printing.getPrinters();
const defaultPrinter = printers.find(async (printer) => {
  const printerInfo = await chrome.printing.getPrinterInfo(printer.id);
  return printerInfo.isDefault;
});
if (defaultPrinter) {
    console.log(`Default printer: ${defaultPrinter.name}.\n\t${defaultPrinter.description}`);
}
```

### submitJob()

The `submitJob()` method requires three things.

*   A ticket structure specifying which capabilities of the printer are to be used. If the user needs to select from available capabilities, you can retrieve them for a specific printer using `getPrinterInfo()`.
*   A `SubmitJobRequest` structure, which specifies the printer to use, and the file or date to print. This structure contains a reference to the ticket structure.
*   A blob of the file or data to print.

Calling `submitJob()` triggers a dialog box asking the user to confirm printing. Use the `PrintingAPIExtensionsAllowlist` to bypass confirmation.

This is a simplified version of the printing example. Notice that the ticket is attached to the `SubmitJobRequest` structure (line 8) and that the data to print is converted to a blob (line 10). Getting the ID of the printer (line 1) is more complicated in the sample than is shown here.

```javascript
// Assuming getDefaultPrinter, getPrinterTicket, getPrintData are defined elsewhere
const defaultPrinterId = getDefaultPrinter(); 
const ticket = getPrinterTicket(defaultPrinterId); 
const arrayBuffer = getPrintData();

const submitJobRequest = {
  job: {
    printerId: defaultPrinterId, 
    title: 'test job',
    ticket: ticket,
    contentType: 'application/pdf',
    document: new Blob([new Uint8Array(arrayBuffer)], { type: 'application/pdf' })
  }
};

chrome.printing.submitJob(submitJobRequest, (response) => {
  if (response !== undefined) {
    console.log(response.status);
  }
  if (chrome.runtime.lastError !== undefined) {
    console.log(chrome.runtime.lastError.message);
  }
});
```

### Roll printing

This example shows how to build a printer ticket for continuous (or roll) printing, which is often used with receipt printing. The `submitJobRequest` object for roll printing is the same as that shown for the `submitJob()` example.

If you need to change the default value for paper cutting, use the `vendor_ticket_item` key. (The default varies from printer to printer.) To change the value, provide an array with one member: an object whose `id` is `'finishings'`. The `value` can either be `'trim'` for printers that cut the roll at the end of printing or `'none'` for printers that require the print job to be torn off.

```javascript
const ticket = {
  version: '1.0',
  print: {
    vendor_ticket_item: [{id: 'finishings', value: 'trim'}],
    color: {type: 'STANDARD_MONOCHROME'},
    duplex: {type: 'NO_DUPLEX'},
    page_orientation: {type: 'PORTRAIT'},
    copies: {copies: 1},
    dpi: {horizontal_dpi: 300, vertical_dpi: 300},
    media_size: {
      width_microns: 72320,
      height_microns: 100000
    },
    collate: {collate: false}
  }
};
```

Some printers do not support the `"finishings"` option. To determine if your printer does, call `getPrinterInfo()` and look for a `"display_name"` of `"finishings/11"`.

```json
"vendor_capability": [
  {
    "display_name": "finishings/11",
    "id": "finishings/11",
    "type": "TYPED_VALUE",
    "typed_value_cap": {
      "value_type": "BOOLEAN"
    }
  },
  ...
]
```

Note: starting with Chrome 124, the `vendor_ticket_item` allows all items from the printer's `vendor_capabilities`. For example, any value return by `getPrinterInfo()` is valid. Before, only the `finishings` key was supported.

The values in a ticket's `media_size` key are specific to each printer. To select an appropriate size call `getPrinterInfo()`. The returned `GetPrinterResponse` contains an array of supported media sizes at `"media_size"."option"`. Choose an option whose `"is_continuous_feed"` value is true. Use its height and width values for the ticket.

```json
"media_size": {
  "option": [
    {
      "custom_display_name": "",
      "is_continuous_feed": true,
      "max_height_microns": 2000000,
      "min_height_microns": 25400,
      "width_microns": 50800
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Methods

### cancelJob()

`Promise`

chrome.printing.cancelJob(
  jobId: string,
  callback?: function,
)
```

Cancels previously submitted job.

#### Parameters

*   `jobId`
    *   `string`
    *   The `id` of the print job to cancel. This should be the same `id` received in a `SubmitJobResponse`.

    *   Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

### getJobStatus()

`Promise` Chrome 135+

```javascript
chrome.printing.getJobStatus(
  jobId: string,
  callback?: function,

#### Parameters

*   `jobId`
    *   `string`

    *   `status`
        *   `JobStatus`

#### Returns

*   `Promise<JobStatus>`
    *   Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

### getPrinterInfo()

`Promise`

```javascript
chrome.printing.getPrinterInfo(
  printerId: string,
  callback?: function,
)
```

Returns the status and capabilities of the printer in CDD format. This call will fail with a runtime error if no printers with given `id` are installed.

#### Parameters

*   `printerId`
    *   `string`
*   `callback`
    *   `function` optional

#### Returns

*   `Promise<GetPrinterInfoResponse>`
    *   Chrome 100+
    *   Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

### getPrinters()

`Promise`

```javascript
chrome.printing.getPrinters(

)
```

Returns the list of available printers on the device. This includes manually added, enterprise and discovered printers.

#### Parameters

### submitJob()

`Promise`

```javascript
chrome.printing.submitJob(
  request: SubmitJobRequest,
  callback?: function,
)
```

Submits the job for printing. If the extension is not listed in the `PrintingAPIExtensionsAllowlist` policy, the user is prompted to accept the print job. Before Chrome 120, this function did not return a promise.

#### Parameters
