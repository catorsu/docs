## Description

Use the `chrome.sessions` API to query and restore tabs and windows from a browsing session.

## Permissions

`sessions`

## Types

### Device

#### Properties

* `deviceName`

  `string`

  The name of the foreign device.
* `sessions`

  `Session[]`

  A list of open window sessions for the foreign device, sorted from most recently to least recently modified session.

### Filter

#### Properties

* `maxResults`

  `number` optional

  The maximum number of entries to be fetched in the requested list. Omit this parameter to fetch the maximum number of entries (`sessions.MAX_SESSION_RESULTS`).

### Session

#### Properties

* `lastModified`

  `number`

  The time when the window or tab was closed or modified, represented in seconds since the epoch.
* `tab`

  `Tab` optional

  The `tabs.Tab`, if this entry describes a tab. Either this or `sessions.Session.window` will be set.
* `window`

  `Window` optional

  The `windows.Window`, if this entry describes a window. Either this or `sessions.Session.tab` will be set.

## Properties

### MAX_SESSION_RESULTS

The maximum number of `sessions.Session` that will be included in a requested list.

#### Value

25

## Methods

### getDevices()

Promise

```
chrome.sessions.getDevices( filter?: Filter, callback?: function, )
```

Retrieves all devices with synced sessions.

#### Parameters

* `filter`

  `Filter` optional
* `callback`

  `function` optional

  The callback parameter looks like:

  ```
  (devices: Device[]) => void
  ```

  + `devices`

    `Device[]`

    The list of `sessions.Device` objects for each synced session, sorted in order from device with most recently modified session to device with least recently modified session. `tabs.Tab` objects are sorted by recency in the `windows.Window` of the `sessions.Session` objects.

#### Returns

* `Promise<Device[]>`

  Chrome 96+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

### getRecentlyClosed()

Promise

```
chrome.sessions.getRecentlyClosed( filter?: Filter, callback?: function, )
```

Gets the list of recently closed tabs and/or windows.

#### Parameters

* `filter`

  `Filter` optional
* `callback`

  `function` optional

  The callback parameter looks like:

  ```
  (sessions: Session[]) => void
  ```

  + `sessions`

    `Session[]`

    The list of closed entries in reverse order that they were closed (the most recently closed tab or window will be at index 0). The entries may contain either tabs or windows.

#### Returns

* `Promise<Session[]>`

  Chrome 96+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

### restore()

Promise

```
chrome.sessions.restore( sessionId?: string, callback?: function, )
```

Reopens a `windows.Window` or `tabs.Tab`, with an optional callback to run when the entry has been restored.

#### Parameters

* `sessionId`

  `string` optional

  The `windows.Window.sessionId`, or `tabs.Tab.sessionId` to restore. If this parameter is not specified, the most recently closed session is restored.
* `callback`

  `function` optional

  The callback parameter looks like:

  ```
  (restoredSession: Session) => void
  ```

  + `restoredSession`

    `Session`

    A `sessions.Session` containing the restored `windows.Window` or `tabs.Tab` object.

#### Returns

* `Promise<Session>`

  Chrome 96+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

## Events

### onChanged

```
chrome.sessions.onChanged.addListener( callback: function, )
```

Fired when recently closed tabs and/or windows are changed. This event does not monitor synced sessions changes.

#### Parameters

* `callback`

  `function`

  The callback parameter looks like:

  ```
  () => void
  ```
