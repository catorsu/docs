## API namespaces and classes

This listing is compiled from the `vscode.d.ts` file from the VS Code repository.

## `l10n`

Namespace for localization-related functionality in the extension API. To use this properly, you must have `l10n` defined in your extension manifest and have `bundle.l10n.<language_code>.json` files. For more information on how to generate `bundle.l10n.<language_code>.json` files, check out the [vscode-l10n](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-l10n) repo.

Note: Built-in extensions (for example, Git, TypeScript Language Features, GitHub Authentication) are excluded from the `l10n` property requirement. In other words, they do not need to specify a `l10n` in the extension manifest because their translated strings come from Language Packs.

#### Variables

*   **`bundle`**: `Record<string, string> | undefined`
    The bundle of localized strings that have been loaded for the extension. It's `undefined` if no bundle has been loaded. The bundle is typically not loaded if there was no bundle found or when we are running with the default language.
*   **`uri`**: `Uri | undefined`
    The URI of the localization bundle that has been loaded for the extension. It's `undefined` if no bundle has been loaded. The bundle is typically not loaded if there was no bundle found or when we are running with the default language.

#### Functions

*   **`t(message: string, ...args: Array<string | number | boolean>): string`**
    Marks a string for localization. If a localized bundle is available for the language specified by `env.language` and the bundle has a localized value for this message, then that localized value will be returned (with injected `args` values for any templated values).

    Example:
    ```javascript
    l10n.t('Hello {0}!', 'World');
    ```

    | Parameter                                       | Description                                                                                                                               |
    | :---------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `message`: string                               | The message to localize. Supports index templating where strings like `{0}` and `{1}` are replaced by the item at that index in the `args` array. |
    | `...args`: `Array<string | number | boolean>` | The arguments to be used in the localized string. The index of the argument is used to match the template placeholder in the localized string. |
    | **Returns**                                     | **Description**                                                                                                                           |
    | `string`                                        | localized string with injected arguments.                                                                                                 |

*   **`t(message: string, args: Record<string, any>): string`**
    Marks a string for localization. If a localized bundle is available for the language specified by `env.language` and the bundle has a localized value for this message, then that localized value will be returned (with injected `args` values for any templated values).

    Example:
    ```javascript
    l10n.t('Hello {name}', { name: 'Erich' });
    ```

    | Parameter                     | Description                                                                                                                                  |
    | :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `message`: string             | The message to localize. Supports named templating where strings like `{foo}` and `{bar}` are replaced by the value in the `Record` for that key (foo, bar, etc). |
    | `args`: `Record<string, any>` | The arguments to be used in the localized string. The name of the key in the record is used to match the template placeholder in the localized string. |
    | **Returns**                   | **Description**                                                                                                                              |
    | `string`                      | localized string with injected arguments.                                                                                                    |

*   **`t(options: {args: Array<string | number | boolean> | Record<string, any>, comment: string | string[], message: string}): string`**
    Marks a string for localization. If a localized bundle is available for the language specified by `env.language` and the bundle has a localized value for this message, then that localized value will be returned (with injected `args` values for any templated values).

    | Parameter                                                                                                     | Description                                  |
    | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- |
    | `options`: {`args`: `Array<string | number | boolean>` \| `Record<string, any>`, `comment`: string \| string[], `message`: string} | The options to use when localizing the message. |
    | **Returns**                                                                                                   | **Description**                              |
    | `string`                                                                                                      | localized string with injected arguments.    |
