## workspace

Namespace for dealing with the current workspace. A workspace is the collection of one or more folders that are opened in an editor window (instance).

It is also possible to open an editor without a workspace. For example, when you open a new editor window by selecting a file from your platform's File menu, you will not be inside a workspace. In this mode, some of the editor's capabilities are reduced but you can still open text files and edit them.

Refer to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces for more information on the concept of workspaces.

The workspace offers support for listening to fs events and for finding files. Both perform well and run outside the editor-process so that they should be always used instead of nodejs-equivalents.

#### Variables

*   **`fs`**: `FileSystem`
    A file system instance that allows to interact with local and remote files, e.g. `vscode.workspace.fs.readDirectory(someUri)` allows to retrieve all entries of a directory or `vscode.workspace.fs.stat(anotherUri)` returns the meta data for a file.
*   **`isTrusted`**: `boolean`
    When true, the user has explicitly trusted the contents of the workspace.
*   **`name`**: `string` | `undefined`
    The name of the workspace. `undefined` when no workspace has been opened.
    Refer to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces for more information on the concept of workspaces.
*   **`notebookDocuments`**: `readonly NotebookDocument[]`
    All notebook documents currently known to the editor.
*   **`rootPath`**: `string` | `undefined`
    The uri of the first entry of `workspaceFolders` as string. `undefined` if there is no first entry.
    Refer to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces for more information on workspaces.
    *   @deprecated - Use `workspaceFolders` instead.
*   **`textDocuments`**: `readonly TextDocument[]`
    All text documents currently known to the editor.
*   **`workspaceFile`**: `Uri` | `undefined`
    The location of the workspace file, for example:
    `file:///Users/name/Development/myProject.code-workspace`
    or
    `untitled:1555503116870`
    for a workspace that is untitled and not yet saved.

    Depending on the workspace that is opened, the value will be:
    *   `undefined` when no workspace is opened
    *   the path of the workspace file as `Uri` otherwise. if the workspace is untitled, the returned URI will use the `untitled:` scheme

    The location can e.g. be used with the `vscode.openFolder` command to open the workspace again after it has been closed.

    Example:
    ```javascript
    vscode.commands.executeCommand('vscode.openFolder', uriOfWorkspace);
    ```
    Refer to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces for more information on the concept of workspaces.

    Note: it is not advised to use `workspace.workspaceFile` to write configuration data into the file. You can use `workspace.getConfiguration().update()` for that purpose which will work both when a single folder is opened as well as an untitled or saved workspace.
*   **`workspaceFolders`**: `readonly WorkspaceFolder[]` | `undefined`
    List of workspace folders (0-N) that are open in the editor. `undefined` when no workspace has been opened.
    Refer to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces for more information on workspaces.

#### Events

*   **`onDidChangeConfiguration`**: `Event<ConfigurationChangeEvent>`
    An event that is emitted when the configuration changed.
*   **`onDidChangeNotebookDocument`**: `Event<NotebookDocumentChangeEvent>`
    An event that is emitted when a notebook has changed.
*   **`onDidChangeTextDocument`**: `Event<TextDocumentChangeEvent>`
    An event that is emitted when a text document is changed. This usually happens when the contents changes but also when other things like the dirty-state changes.
*   **`onDidChangeWorkspaceFolders`**: `Event<WorkspaceFoldersChangeEvent>`
    An event that is emitted when a workspace folder is added or removed.
    Note: this event will not fire if the first workspace folder is added, removed or changed, because in that case the currently executing extensions (including the one that listens to this event) will be terminated and restarted so that the (deprecated) `rootPath` property is updated to point to the first workspace folder.
*   **`onDidCloseNotebookDocument`**: `Event<NotebookDocument>`
    An event that is emitted when a notebook is disposed.
    Note 1: There is no guarantee that this event fires when an editor tab is closed.
    Note 2: A notebook can be open but not shown in an editor which means this event can fire for a notebook that has not been shown in an editor.
*   **`onDidCloseTextDocument`**: `Event<TextDocument>`
    An event that is emitted when a text document is disposed or when the language id of a text document has been changed.
    Note 1: There is no guarantee that this event fires when an editor tab is closed, use the `onDidChangeVisibleTextEditors`-event to know when editors change.
    Note 2: A document can be open but not shown in an editor which means this event can fire for a document that has not been shown in an editor.
*   **`onDidCreateFiles`**: `Event<FileCreateEvent>`
    An event that is emitted when files have been created.
    Note: This event is triggered by user gestures, like creating a file from the explorer, or from the `workspace.applyEdit`-api, but this event is not fired when files change on disk, e.g triggered by another application, or when using the `workspace.fs`-api.
*   **`onDidDeleteFiles`**: `Event<FileDeleteEvent>`
    An event that is emitted when files have been deleted.
    Note 1: This event is triggered by user gestures, like deleting a file from the explorer, or from the `workspace.applyEdit`-api, but this event is not fired when files change on disk, e.g triggered by another application, or when using the `workspace.fs`-api.
    Note 2: When deleting a folder with children only one event is fired.
*   **`onDidGrantWorkspaceTrust`**: `Event<void>`
    Event that fires when the current workspace has been trusted.
*   **`onDidOpenNotebookDocument`**: `Event<NotebookDocument>`
    An event that is emitted when a notebook is opened.
*   **`onDidOpenTextDocument`**: `Event<TextDocument>`
    An event that is emitted when a text document is opened or when the language id of a text document has been changed.
    To add an event listener when a visible text document is opened, use the `TextEditor` events in the `window` namespace. Note that:
    *   The event is emitted before the document is updated in the active text editor
    *   When a text document is already open (e.g.: open in another visible text editor) this event is not emitted
*   **`onDidRenameFiles`**: `Event<FileRenameEvent>`
    An event that is emitted when files have been renamed.
    Note 1: This event is triggered by user gestures, like renaming a file from the explorer, and from the `workspace.applyEdit`-api, but this event is not fired when files change on disk, e.g triggered by another application, or when using the `workspace.fs`-api.
    Note 2: When renaming a folder with children only one event is fired.
*   **`onDidSaveNotebookDocument`**: `Event<NotebookDocument>`
    An event that is emitted when a notebook is saved.
*   **`onDidSaveTextDocument`**: `Event<TextDocument>`
    An event that is emitted when a text document is saved to disk.
*   **`onWillCreateFiles`**: `Event<FileWillCreateEvent>`
    An event that is emitted when files are being created.
    Note 1: This event is triggered by user gestures, like creating a file from the explorer, or from the `workspace.applyEdit`-api. This event is not fired when files change on disk, e.g triggered by another application, or when using the `workspace.fs`-api.
    Note 2: When this event is fired, edits to files that are are being created cannot be applied.
*   **`onWillDeleteFiles`**: `Event<FileWillDeleteEvent>`
    An event that is emitted when files are being deleted.
    Note 1: This event is triggered by user gestures, like deleting a file from the explorer, or from the `workspace.applyEdit`-api, but this event is not fired when files change on disk, e.g triggered by another application, or when using the `workspace.fs`-api.
    Note 2: When deleting a folder with children only one event is fired.
*   **`onWillRenameFiles`**: `Event<FileWillRenameEvent>`
    An event that is emitted when files are being renamed.
    Note 1: This event is triggered by user gestures, like renaming a file from the explorer, and from the `workspace.applyEdit`-api, but this event is not fired when files change on disk, e.g triggered by another application, or when using the `workspace.fs`-api.
    Note 2: When renaming a folder with children only one event is fired.
*   **`onWillSaveNotebookDocument`**: `Event<NotebookDocumentWillSaveEvent>`
    An event that is emitted when a notebook document will be saved to disk.
    Note 1: Subscribers can delay saving by registering asynchronous work. For the sake of data integrity the editor might save without firing this event. For instance when shutting down with dirty files.
    Note 2: Subscribers are called sequentially and they can delay saving by registering asynchronous work. Protection against misbehaving listeners is implemented as such:
    *   there is an overall time budget that all listeners share and if that is exhausted no further listener is called
    *   listeners that take a long time or produce errors frequently will not be called anymore
    The current thresholds are 1.5 seconds as overall time budget and a listener can misbehave 3 times before being ignored.
*   **`onWillSaveTextDocument`**: `Event<TextDocumentWillSaveEvent>`
    An event that is emitted when a text document will be saved to disk.
    Note 1: Subscribers can delay saving by registering asynchronous work. For the sake of data integrity the editor might save without firing this event. For instance when shutting down with dirty files.
    Note 2: Subscribers are called sequentially and they can delay saving by registering asynchronous work. Protection against misbehaving listeners is implemented as such:
    *   there is an overall time budget that all listeners share and if that is exhausted no further listener is called
    *   listeners that take a long time or produce errors frequently will not be called anymore
    The current thresholds are 1.5 seconds as overall time budget and a listener can misbehave 3 times before being ignored.

#### Functions

*   **`applyEdit(edit: WorkspaceEdit, metadata?: WorkspaceEditMetadata): Thenable<boolean>`**
    Make changes to one or many resources or create, delete, and rename resources as defined by the given workspace edit.

    All changes of a workspace edit are applied in the same order in which they have been added. If multiple textual inserts are made at the same position, these strings appear in the resulting text in the order the 'inserts' were made, unless that are interleaved with resource edits. Invalid sequences like 'delete file a' -> 'insert text in file a' cause failure of the operation.

    When applying a workspace edit that consists only of text edits an 'all-or-nothing'-strategy is used. A workspace edit with resource creations or deletions aborts the operation, e.g. consecutive edits will not be attempted, when a single edit fails.

    | Parameter                         | Description                         |
    | :-------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
    | `edit`: `WorkspaceEdit`           | A workspace edit.                   |
    | `metadata?`: `WorkspaceEditMetadata` | Optional metadata for the edit.     |
    | **Returns**                       | **Description**                     |
    | `Thenable<boolean>`               | A thenable that resolves when the edit could be applied. |

*   **`asRelativePath(pathOrUri: string | Uri, includeWorkspaceFolder?: boolean): string`**
    Returns a path that is relative to the workspace folder or folders.

    When there are no workspace folders or when the path is not contained in them, the input is returned.

    | Parameter                               | Description                                                                                                                                        |
    | :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `pathOrUri`: `string` \| `Uri`            | A path or uri. When a uri is given its `fsPath` is used.                                                                                             |
    | `includeWorkspaceFolder?`: `boolean`    | When true and when the given path is contained inside a workspace folder the name of the workspace is prepended. Defaults to true when there are multiple workspace folders and false otherwise. |
    | **Returns**                             | **Description**                                                                                                                                    |
    | `string`                                | A path relative to the root or the input.                                                                                                          |

*   **`createFileSystemWatcher(globPattern: GlobPattern, ignoreCreateEvents?: boolean, ignoreChangeEvents?: boolean, ignoreDeleteEvents?: boolean): FileSystemWatcher`**
    Creates a file system watcher that is notified on file events (create, change, delete) depending on the parameters provided.

    By default, all opened workspace folders will be watched for file changes recursively.

    Additional paths can be added for file watching by providing a `RelativePattern` with a base path to watch. If the path is a folder and the pattern is complex (e.g. contains `**` or path segments), it will be watched recursively and otherwise will be watched non-recursively (i.e. only changes to the first level of the path will be reported).

    Note that paths that do not exist in the file system will be monitored with a delay until created and then watched depending on the parameters provided. If a watched path is deleted, the watcher will suspend and not report any events until the path is created again.

    If possible, keep the use of recursive watchers to a minimum because recursive file watching is quite resource intense.

    Providing a string as `globPattern` acts as convenience method for watching file events in all opened workspace folders. It cannot be used to add more folders for file watching, nor will it report any file events from folders that are not part of the opened workspace folders.

    Optionally, flags to ignore certain kinds of events can be provided.

    To stop listening to events the watcher must be disposed.

    Note that file events from recursive file watchers may be excluded based on user configuration. The setting `files.watcherExclude` helps to reduce the overhead of file events from folders that are known to produce many file changes at once (such as `.git` folders). As such, it is highly recommended to watch with simple patterns that do not require recursive watchers where the exclude settings are ignored and you have full control over the events.

    Note that symbolic links are not automatically followed for file watching unless the path to watch itself is a symbolic link.

    Note that the file paths that are reported for having changed may have a different path casing compared to the actual casing on disk on case-insensitive platforms (typically macOS and Windows but not Linux). We allow a user to open a workspace folder with any desired path casing and try to preserve that. This means:
    *   if the path is within any of the workspace folders, the path will match the casing of the workspace folder up to that portion of the path and match the casing on disk for children
    *   if the path is outside of any of the workspace folders, the casing will match the case of the path that was provided for watching In the same way, symbolic links are preserved, i.e. the file event will report the path of the symbolic link as it was provided for watching and not the target.

    ### Examples
    The basic anatomy of a file watcher is as follows:
    ```javascript
    const watcher = vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(new vscode.RelativePattern(<folder>, <pattern>));
    watcher.onDidChange(uri => { ... }); // listen to files being changed
    watcher.onDidCreate(uri => { ... }); // listen to files/folders being created
    watcher.onDidDelete(uri => { ... }); // listen to files/folders getting deleted
    watcher.dispose(); // dispose after usage
    ```

    #### Workspace file watching
    If you only care about file events in a specific workspace folder:
    ```javascript
    vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher( new vscode.RelativePattern(vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders[0], '**/*.js') );
    ```
    If you want to monitor file events across all opened workspace folders:
    ```javascript
    vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher('**/*.js');
    ```
    Note: the array of workspace folders can be empty if no workspace is opened (empty window).

    #### Out of workspace file watching
    To watch a folder for changes to `*.js` files outside the workspace (non recursively), pass in a `Uri` to such a folder:
    ```javascript
    vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(new vscode.RelativePattern(vscode.Uri.file(<path to folder outside workspace>), '*.js'));
    ```
    And use a complex glob pattern to watch recursively:
    ```javascript
    vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(new vscode.RelativePattern(vscode.Uri.file(<path to folder outside workspace>), '**/*.js'));
    ```
    Here is an example for watching the active editor for file changes:
    ```javascript
    vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher( new vscode.RelativePattern(vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document.uri, '*') );
    ```

When `undefined`, default file-excludes (e.g. the `files.exclude`-setting but not `search.exclude`) will apply. When `null`, no excludes will apply. |
    | `maxResults?`: `number`    | An upper-bound for the result.                                                                                                                                                      |

    | `Thenable<Uri[]>`        | A thenable that resolves to an array of resource identifiers. Will return no results if no workspace folders are opened.                                                              |

*   **`getConfiguration(section?: string, scope?: ConfigurationScope): WorkspaceConfiguration`**
    Get a workspace configuration object.

    When a section-identifier is provided only that part of the configuration is returned. Dots in the section-identifier are interpreted as child-access, like `{ myExt: { setting: { doIt: true }}}` and `getConfiguration('myExt.setting').get('doIt') === true`.

    When a scope is provided configuration confined to that scope is returned. Scope can be a resource or a language identifier or both.

    | Parameter                     | Description                                         |

    | `section?`: `string`            | A dot-separated identifier.                         |
    | `scope?`: `ConfigurationScope`  | A scope for which the configuration is asked for.   |
    | **Returns**                   | **Description**                                     |
    | `WorkspaceConfiguration`      | The full configuration or a subset.                 |

*   **`getWorkspaceFolder(uri: Uri): WorkspaceFolder | undefined`**
    Returns the workspace folder that contains a given uri.
    *   returns `undefined` when the given uri doesn't match any workspace folder
    *   returns the input when the given uri is a workspace folder itself

    | Parameter       | Description                |
    | :-------------- | :------------------------- |
    | `uri`: `Uri`      | An uri.                    |
    | **Returns**     | **Description**            |
    | `WorkspaceFolder` | `undefined` | A workspace folder or `undefined` |

*   **`openNotebookDocument(uri: Uri): Thenable<NotebookDocument>`**
    Open a notebook. Will return early if this notebook is already loaded. Otherwise the notebook is loaded and the `onDidOpenNotebookDocument`-event fires.

    Note that the lifecycle of the returned notebook is owned by the editor and not by the extension. That means an `onDidCloseNotebookDocument`-event can occur at any time after.

    Note that opening a notebook does not show a notebook editor. This function only returns a notebook document which can be shown in a notebook editor but it can also be used for other things.

    | Parameter       | Description                 |
    | :-------------- | :-------------------------- |
    | `uri`: `Uri`      | The resource to open.       |
    | **Returns**     | **Description**             |
    | `Thenable<NotebookDocument>` | A promise that resolves to a notebook |

*   **`openNotebookDocument(notebookType: string, content?: NotebookData): Thenable<NotebookDocument>`**
    Open an untitled notebook. The editor will prompt the user for a file path when the document is to be saved.

    See also `workspace.openNotebookDocument`

    | Parameter                  | Description                               |

    | `notebookType`: `string`     | The notebook type that should be used.    |
    | `content?`: `NotebookData`   | The initial contents of the notebook.     |
    | **Returns**                | **Description**                           |
    | `Thenable<NotebookDocument>` | A promise that resolves to a notebook.    |

*   **`openTextDocument(uri: Uri, options?: {encoding: string}): Thenable<TextDocument>`**
    Opens a document. Will return early if this document is already open. Otherwise the document is loaded and the `didOpen`-event fires.

    The document is denoted by an `Uri`. Depending on the scheme the following rules apply:
    *   `file`-scheme: Open a file on disk (`openTextDocument(Uri.file(path))`). Will be rejected if the file does not exist or cannot be loaded.
    *   `untitled`-scheme: Open a blank untitled file with associated path (`openTextDocument(Uri.file(path).with({ scheme: 'untitled' }))`). The language will be derived from the file name.
    *   For all other schemes contributed text document content providers and file system providers are consulted.

    Note that the lifecycle of the returned document is owned by the editor and not by the extension. That means an `onDidClose`-event can occur at any time after opening it.

*   **`updateWorkspaceFolders(start: number, deleteCount: number, ...workspaceFoldersToAdd: Array<{name: string, uri: Uri}>): boolean`**
    This method replaces `deleteCount` workspace folders starting at index `start` by an optional set of `workspaceFoldersToAdd` on the `vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders` array. This "splice" behavior can be used to add, remove and change workspace folders in a single operation.

    Note: in some cases calling this method may result in the currently executing extensions (including the one that called this method) to be terminated and restarted. For example when the first workspace folder is added, removed or changed the (deprecated) `rootPath` property is updated to point to the first workspace folder. Another case is when transitioning from an empty or single-folder workspace into a multi-folder workspace (see also: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces).

    Use the `onDidChangeWorkspaceFolders()` event to get notified when the workspace folders have been updated.

    Example: adding a new workspace folder at the end of workspace folders
    ```javascript
    workspace.updateWorkspaceFolders(workspace.workspaceFolders ? workspace.workspaceFolders.length : 0, null, { uri: ...});
    ```
    Example: removing the first workspace folder
    ```javascript
    workspace.updateWorkspaceFolders(0, 1);
    ```
    Example: replacing an existing workspace folder with a new one
    ```javascript
    workspace.updateWorkspaceFolders(0, 1, { uri: ...});
    ```
    It is valid to remove an existing workspace folder and add it again with a different name to rename that folder.

    Note: it is not valid to call `updateWorkspaceFolders()` multiple times without waiting for the `onDidChangeWorkspaceFolders()` to fire.

    Role of the widget which defines how a screen reader interacts with it. The role should be set in special cases when for example a tree-like element behaves like a checkbox. If role is not specified the editor will pick the appropriate role automatically. More about aria roles can be found here https://w3c.github.io/aria/#widget_roles

### AuthenticationForceNewSessionOptions

Optional options to be used when calling `authentication.getSession` with the flag `forceNewSession`.
*   @deprecated - Use `AuthenticationGetSessionPresentationOptions` instead.

`AuthenticationForceNewSessionOptions`: `AuthenticationGetSessionPresentationOptions`

### AuthenticationGetSessionOptions

Options to be used when getting an `AuthenticationSession` from an `AuthenticationProvider`.

#### Properties

*   **`account?`**: `AuthenticationSessionAccountInformation`
    The account that you would like to get a session for. This is passed down to the `AuthenticationProvider` to be used for creating the correct session.
*   **`clearSessionPreference?`**: `boolean`
    Whether the existing session preference should be cleared.

    For authentication providers that support being signed into multiple accounts at once, the user will be prompted to select an account to use when `getSession` is called. This preference is remembered until `getSession` is called with this flag.

    Note: The preference is extension specific. So if one extension calls `getSession`, it will not affect the session preference for another extension calling `getSession`. Additionally, the preference is set for the current workspace and also globally. This means that new workspaces will use the "global" value at first and then when this flag is provided, a new value can be set for that workspace. This also means that pre-existing workspaces will not lose their preference if a new workspace sets this flag.

    Defaults to `false`.
*   **`createIfNone?`**: `boolean` | `AuthenticationGetSessionPresentationOptions`
    Whether login should be performed if there is no matching session.

    If `true`, a modal dialog will be shown asking the user to sign in. If `false`, a numbered badge will be shown on the accounts activity bar icon. An entry for the extension will be added under the menu to sign in. This allows quietly prompting the user to sign in.

    If you provide options, you will also see the dialog but with the additional context provided.

    If there is a matching session but the extension has not been granted access to it, setting this to `true` will also result in an immediate modal dialog, and `false` will add a numbered badge to the accounts icon.

    Defaults to `false`.

    Note: you cannot use this option with `silent`.
*   **`forceNewSession?`**: `boolean` | `AuthenticationGetSessionPresentationOptions`
    Whether we should attempt to reauthenticate even if there is already a session available.

    If `true`, a modal dialog will be shown asking the user to sign in again. This is mostly used for scenarios where the token needs to be re minted because it has lost some authorization.

    If you provide options, you will also see the dialog but with the additional context provided.

    If there are no existing sessions and `forceNewSession` is `true`, it will behave identically to `createIfNone`.

    This defaults to `false`.
*   **`silent?`**: `boolean`
    Whether we should show the indication to sign in in the Accounts menu.

    If `false`, the user will be shown a badge on the Accounts menu with an option to sign in for the extension. If `true`, no indication will be shown.

    Defaults to `false`.

    Note: you cannot use this option with any other options that prompt the user like `createIfNone`.

### AuthenticationGetSessionPresentationOptions

Optional options to be used when calling `authentication.getSession` with interactive options `forceNewSession` & `createIfNone`.

#### Properties

*   **`detail?`**: `string`
    An optional message that will be displayed to the user when we ask to re-authenticate. Providing additional context as to why you are asking a user to re-authenticate can help increase the odds that they will accept.

    The tool name. Refers to a tool listed in `lm.tools`.
*   **`range?`**: [`start`: `number`, `end`: `number`]
    The start and end index of the reference in the prompt. When undefined, the reference was not part of the prompt text.
    Note that the indices take the leading `#`-character into account which means they can be used to modify the prompt as-is.

### ChatParticipant

A chat participant can be invoked by the user in a chat session, using the prefix. When it is invoked, it handles the chat request and is solely responsible for providing a response to the user. A `ChatParticipant` is created using `chat.createChatParticipant`.

#### Events

*   **`onDidReceiveFeedback`**: `Event<ChatResultFeedback>`
    An event that fires whenever feedback for a result is received, e.g. when a user up- or down-votes a result.
    The passed result is guaranteed to have the same properties as the result that was previously returned from this chat participant's handler.

#### Properties

*   **`followupProvider?`**: `ChatFollowupProvider`
    This provider will be called once after each request to retrieve suggested followup questions.
*   **`iconPath?`**: `IconPath`
    An icon for the participant shown in UI.
*   **`id`**: `string`
    A unique ID for this participant.
*   **`requestHandler`**: `ChatRequestHandler`
    The handler for requests to this participant.

#### Methods

*   **`dispose(): void`**

    | Parameter   | Description     |
    | :---------- | :-------------- |
    | **Returns** | **Description** |
    | `void`      |                 |

### ChatParticipantToolToken

A token that can be passed to `lm.invokeTool` when invoking a tool inside the context of handling a chat request.

    A unique identifier for this kind of reference.
*   **`modelDescription?`**: `string`
    A description of this value that could be used in an LLM prompt.
*   **`range?`**: [`start`: `number`, `end`: `number`]
    The start and end index of the reference in the prompt. When undefined, the reference was not part of the prompt text.
    Note that the indices take the leading `#`-character into account which means they can used to modify the prompt as-is.
*   **`value`**: `unknown`
    The value of this reference. The `string` | `Uri` | `Location` types are used today, but this could expand in the future.

### ChatRequest

A request to a chat participant.

#### Properties

*   **`command`**: `string`
    The name of the [`ChatCommand` command](#ChatCommand-command) that was selected for this request.
*   **`model`**: `LanguageModelChat`
    This is the model that is currently selected in the UI. Extensions can use this or use `lm.selectChatModels` to pick another model. Don't hold onto this past the lifetime of the request.
*   **`prompt`**: `string`
    The prompt as entered by the user.
    Information about references used in this request is stored in `ChatRequest.references`.
    Note that the [`ChatParticipant.name` name](#ChatParticipant.name-name) of the participant and the [`ChatCommand.name` command](#ChatCommand.name-command) are not part of the prompt.
*   **`references`**: `readonly ChatPromptReference[]`
    The list of references and their values that are referenced in the prompt.
    Note that the prompt contains references as authored and that it is up to the participant to further modify the prompt, for instance by inlining reference values or creating links to headings which contain the resolved values. References are sorted in reverse by their range in the prompt. That means the last reference in the prompt is the first in this list. This simplifies string-manipulation of the prompt.
*   **`toolInvocationToken`**: `never`
    A token that can be passed to `lm.invokeTool` when invoking a tool inside the context of handling a chat request. This associates the tool invocation to a chat session.
*   **`toolReferences`**: `readonly ChatLanguageModelToolReference[]`
    The list of tools that the user attached to their request.
    When a tool reference is present, the chat participant should make a chat request using `LanguageModelChatToolMode.Required` to force the language model to generate input for the tool. Then, the participant can use `lm.invokeTool` to use the tool attach the result to its request for the user's prompt. The tool may contribute useful extra context for the user's request.

    *   Disabled actions are shown as faded out in the code action menu when the user request a more specific type of code action, such as refactorings.
    *   If the user has a keybinding that auto applies a code action and only a disabled code actions are returned, the editor will show the user an error message with `reason` in the editor.

    | Parameter        | Description                                                                                                |

    Used to filter code actions.
*   **`title`**: `string`
    A short, human-readable, title for this code action.

### CodeActionContext

    Requested kind of actions to return.
    Actions not of this kind are filtered out before being shown by the lightbulb.
*   **`triggerKind`**: `CodeActionTriggerKind`
    The reason why code actions were requested.

### CodeActionKind

Kind of a code action.

Kinds are a hierarchical list of identifiers separated by `.`, e.g. `"refactor.extract.function"`.

Code action kinds are used by the editor for UI elements such as the refactoring context menu. Users can also trigger code actions with a specific kind with the `editor.action.codeAction` command.

#### Static

*   **`Empty`**: `CodeActionKind`
    Empty kind.
*   **`Notebook`**: `CodeActionKind`
    Base kind for all code actions applying to the entire notebook's scope. `CodeActionKind`s using this should always begin with `notebook.`.
    This requires that new `CodeAction`s be created for it and contributed via extensions. Pre-existing kinds can not just have the new `notebook.` prefix added to them, as the functionality is unique to the full-notebook scope.
    `Notebook` `CodeActionKind`s can be initialized as either of the following (both resulting in `notebook.source.xyz`):
    *   `const newKind = CodeActionKind.Notebook.append(CodeActionKind.Source.append('xyz').value)`
    *   `const newKind = CodeActionKind.Notebook.append('source.xyz')`
    Example Kinds/Actions:
    *   `notebook.source.organizeImports` (might move all imports to a new top cell)
    *   `notebook.source.normalizeVariableNames` (might rename all variables to a standardized casing format)
*   **`QuickFix`**: `CodeActionKind`
    Base kind for quickfix actions: `quickfix`.
    Quick fix actions address a problem in the code and are shown in the normal code action context menu.
*   **`Refactor`**: `CodeActionKind`
    Base kind for refactoring actions: `refactor`
    Refactoring actions are shown in the refactoring context menu.
*   **`RefactorExtract`**: `CodeActionKind`
    Base kind for refactoring extraction actions: `refactor.extract`
    Example extract actions:
    *   Extract method
    *   Extract function
    *   Extract variable
    *   Extract interface from class
    *   ...
*   **`RefactorInline`**: `CodeActionKind`
    Base kind for refactoring inline actions: `refactor.inline`
    Example inline actions:
    *   Inline function
    *   Inline variable
    *   Inline constant
    *   ...
*   **`RefactorMove`**: `CodeActionKind`
    Base kind for refactoring move actions: `refactor.move`
    Example move actions:
    *   Move a function to a new file
    *   Move a property between classes
    *   Move method to base class
    *   ...
*   **`RefactorRewrite`**: `CodeActionKind`
    Base kind for refactoring rewrite actions: `refactor.rewrite`
    Example rewrite actions:
    *   Convert JavaScript function to class
    *   Add or remove parameter
    *   Encapsulate field
    *   Make method static
    *   ...
*   **`Source`**: `CodeActionKind`
    Base kind for source actions: `source`
    Source code actions apply to the entire file. They must be explicitly requested and will not show in the normal lightbulb menu. Source actions can be run on save using `editor.codeActionsOnSave` and are also shown in the source context menu.
*   **`SourceFixAll`**: `CodeActionKind`
    Base kind for auto-fix source actions: `source.fixAll`.
    Fix all actions automatically fix errors that have a clear fix that do not require user input. They should not suppress errors or perform unsafe fixes such as generating new types or classes.
*   **`SourceOrganizeImports`**: `CodeActionKind`
    Base kind for an organize imports source action: `source.organizeImports`.

#### Constructors

*   **`new CodeActionKind(value: string): CodeActionKind`**
    Private constructor, use static `CodeActionKind.XYZ` to derive from an existing code action kind.

    | Parameter         | Description                                    |

    The kind `"refactor.extract"` for example contains `"refactor.extract"` and `` `"refactor.extract.function" ``, but not `"unicorn.refactor.extract"`, or `"refactor.extractAll"`or`refactor`.

    | Parameter              | Description     |
    | :--------------------- | :-------------- |
    | `other`: `CodeActionKind` | Kind to check.  |
    | **Returns**            | **Description** |

### CodeActionProvider<T>

Provides contextual actions for code. Code actions typically either fix problems or beautify/refactor code.

Code actions are surfaced to users in a few different ways:

*   The lightbulb feature, which shows a list of code actions at the current cursor position. The lightbulb's list of actions includes both quick fixes and refactorings.
*   As commands that users can run, such as `Refactor`. Users can run these from the command palette or with keybindings.
*   As source actions, such `Organize Imports`.
*   Quick fixes are shown in the problems view.
*   Change applied on save by the `editor.codeActionsOnSave` setting.

#### Methods

*   **`provideCodeActions(document: TextDocument, range: Range | Selection, context: CodeActionContext, token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<Array<Command | T>>`**
    Get code actions for a given range in a document.

    Only return code actions that are relevant to user for the requested range. Also keep in mind how the returned code actions will appear in the UI. The lightbulb widget and Refactor commands for instance show returned code actions as a list, so do not return a large number of code actions that will overwhelm the user.

    | Parameter                                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
    | :------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `document`: `TextDocument`                                    | The document in which the command was invoked.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
    | `range`: `Range` \| `Selection`                                 | The selector or range for which the command was invoked. This will always be a selection if the actions are being requested in the currently active editor.                                                                        |
    | `context`: `CodeActionContext`                                | Provides additional information about what code actions are being requested. You can use this to see what specific type of code actions are being requested by the editor in order to return more relevant actions and avoid returning irrelevant code actions that the editor will discard. |
    | `token`: `CancellationToken`                                  | A cancellation token.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

    | `ProviderResult<Array<Command | T>>` | An array of code actions, such as quick fixes or refactorings. The lack of a result can be signaled by returning `undefined`, `null`, or an empty array.  We also support returning `Command` for legacy reasons, however all new extensions should return `CodeAction` object instead. |

*   **`resolveCodeAction(codeAction: T, token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<T>`**
    Given a code action fill in its `edit`-property. Changes to all other properties, like `title`, are ignored. A code action that has an `edit` will not be resolved.

    Note that a code action provider that returns commands, not code actions, cannot successfully implement this function. Returning commands is deprecated and instead code actions should be returned.

### CodeActionProviderMetadata

Metadata about the type of code actions that a `CodeActionProvider` provides.

#### Properties

*   **`documentation?`**: `ReadonlyArray<{command: Command, kind: CodeActionKind}>`
    Static documentation for a class of code actions.

    Documentation from the provider is shown in the code actions menu if either:
    *   Code actions of `kind` are requested by the editor. In this case, the editor will show the documentation that most closely matches the requested code action kind. For example, if a provider has documentation for both `Refactor` and `RefactorExtract`, when the user requests code actions for `RefactorExtract`, the editor will use the documentation for `RefactorExtract` instead of the documentation for `Refactor`.
    *   Any code actions of `kind` are returned by the provider.

    At most one documentation entry will be shown per provider.
*   **`providedCodeActionKinds?`**: `readonly CodeActionKind[]`
    List of `CodeActionKind`s that a `CodeActionProvider` may return.

    This list is used to determine if a given `CodeActionProvider` should be invoked or not. To avoid unnecessary computation, every `CodeActionProvider` should list use `providedCodeActionKinds`. The list of kinds may either be generic, such as `[CodeActionKind.Refactor]`, or list out every kind provided, such as `[CodeActionKind.Refactor.Extract.append('function'), CodeActionKind.Refactor.Extract.append('constant'), ...]`.

### CodeActionTriggerKind

The reason why code actions were requested.

#### Enumeration Members

*   **`Invoke`**: `1`
    Code actions were explicitly requested by the user or by an extension.
*   **`Automatic`**: `2`
    Code actions were requested automatically.
    This typically happens when current selection in a file changes, but can also be triggered when file content changes.

### CodeLens

A code lens represents a `Command` that should be shown along with source text, like the number of references, a way to run tests, etc.

A code lens is unresolved when no command is associated to it. For performance reasons the creation of a code lens and resolving should be done to two stages.

    A human-readable string with additional information about this item, like type or symbol information.
*   **`documentation?`**: `string` | `MarkdownString`
    A human-readable string that represents a doc-comment.
*   **`filterText?`**: `string`
    A string that should be used when filtering a set of completion items. When falsy the `label` is used.
    Note that the filter text is matched against the leading word (prefix) which is defined by the `range`-property.
*   **`insertText?`**: `string` | `SnippetString`
    A string or snippet that should be inserted in a document when selecting this completion. When falsy the `label` is used.
*   **`keepWhitespace?`**: `boolean`
    Keep whitespace of the `insertText` as is. By default, the editor adjusts leading whitespace of new lines so that they match the indentation of the line for which the item is accepted - setting this to `true` will prevent that.
*   **`kind?`**: `CompletionItemKind`
    The kind of this completion item. Based on the kind an icon is chosen by the editor.
*   **`label`**: `string` | `CompletionItemLabel`
    The label of this completion item. By default this is also the text that is inserted when selecting this completion.
*   **`preselect?`**: `boolean`
    Select this item when showing. Note that only one completion item can be selected and that the editor decides which item that is. The rule is that the first item of those that match best is selected.
*   **`range?`**: `Range` | {`inserting`: `Range`, `replacing`: `Range`}
    A range or a insert and replace range selecting the text that should be replaced by this completion item.
    When omitted, the range of the current word is used as replace-range and as insert-range the start of the current word to the current position is used.
    Note 1: A range must be a single line and it must contain the position at which completion has been requested.
    Note 2: A insert range must be a prefix of a replace range, that means it must be contained and starting at the same position.
*   **`sortText?`**: `string`
    A string that should be used when comparing this item with other items. When falsy the `label` is used.
    Note that `sortText` is only used for the initial ordering of completion items. When having a leading word (prefix) ordering is based on how well completions match that prefix and the initial ordering is only used when completions match equally well. The prefix is defined by the `range`-property and can therefore be different for each completion.
*   **`tags?`**: `readonly CompletionItemTag[]`
    Tags for this completion item.
*   **`textEdit?`**: `TextEdit`
    *   @deprecated - Use `CompletionItem.insertText` and `CompletionItem.range` instead.
    An edit which is applied to a document when selecting this completion. When an edit is provided the value of `insertText` is ignored.
    The `Range` of the edit must be single-line and on the same line completions were requested at.

### CompletionItemProvider<T>

The completion item provider interface defines the contract between extensions and IntelliSense.

Providers can delay the computation of the `detail` and `documentation` properties by implementing the `resolveCompletionItem`-function. However, properties that are needed for the initial sorting and filtering, like `sortText`, `filterText`, `insertText`, and `range`, must not be changed during resolve.

Providers are asked for completions either explicitly by a user gesture or -depending on the configuration- implicitly when typing words or trigger characters.

#### Methods

*   **`provideCompletionItems(document: TextDocument, position: Position, token: CancellationToken, context: CompletionContext): ProviderResult<CompletionList<T> | T[]>`**
    Provide completion items for the given position and document.

    | Parameter                                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                              |

    | `ProviderResult<CompletionList<T> | T[]>` | An array of completions, a completion list, or a thenable that resolves to either. The lack of a result can be signaled by returning `undefined`, `null`, or an empty array. |

*   **`resolveCompletionItem(item: T, token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<T>`**
    Given a completion item fill in more data, like doc-comment or details.

    The editor will only resolve a completion item once.

    Note that this function is called when completion items are already showing in the UI or when an item has been selected for insertion. Because of that, no property that changes the presentation (label, sorting, filtering etc) or the (primary) insert behaviour (`insertText`) can be changed.

    This function may fill in `additionalTextEdits`. However, that means an item might be inserted before resolving is done and in that case the editor will do a best effort to still apply those additional text edits.

    | Parameter                    | Description                                                                                                                                            |
    | :--------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `item`: `T`                  | A completion item currently active in the UI.                                                                                                          |
    | `token`: `CancellationToken` | A cancellation token.                                                                                                                                  |
    | **Returns**                  | **Description**                                                                                                                                        |
    | `ProviderResult<T>`          | The resolved completion item or a thenable that resolves to of such. It is OK to return the given item. When no result is returned, the given item will be used. |

### CompletionItemTag

Completion item tags are extra annotations that tweak the rendering of a completion item.

#### Enumeration Members

*   **`Deprecated`**: `1`
    Render a completion as obsolete, usually using a strike-out.

### CompletionList<T>

Represents a collection of completion items to be presented in the editor.

#### Constructors

*   **`new CompletionList<T extends CompletionItem>(items?: T[], isIncomplete?: boolean): CompletionList<T>`**
    Creates a new completion list.

    | Parameter                 | Description                    |
    | :------------------------ | :----------------------------- |
    | `items?`: `T[]`           | The completion items.          |
    | `isIncomplete?`: `boolean` | The list is not complete.      |
    | **Returns**               | **Description**                |
    | `CompletionList<T>`       |                                |

#### Properties

### CompletionTriggerKind

How a completion provider was triggered

#### Enumeration Members

*   **`Invoke`**: `0`
    Completion was triggered normally.
*   **`TriggerCharacter`**: `1`
    Completion was triggered by a trigger character.
*   **`TriggerForIncompleteCompletions`**: `2`

### ConfigurationChangeEvent

An event describing the change in `Configuration`

#### Methods

*   **`affectsConfiguration(section: string, scope?: ConfigurationScope): boolean`**
    Checks if the given section has changed. If `scope` is provided, checks if the section has changed for resources under the given scope.

    | Parameter                   | Description                                  |
    | :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
    | `section`: `string`         | Configuration name, supports dotted names.   |
    | `scope?`: `ConfigurationScope` | A scope in which to check.                 |
    | **Returns**                 | **Description**                              |
    | `boolean`                   | `true` if the given section has changed.     |

### ConfigurationScope

The configuration scope which can be:
*   a `Uri` representing a resource
*   a `TextDocument` representing an open text document
*   a `WorkspaceFolder` representing a workspace folder
*   an object containing:
    *   `uri`: an optional `Uri` of a text document

*   **`Workspace`**: `2`
    Workspace configuration
*   **`WorkspaceFolder`**: `3`
    Workspace folder configuration

### CustomDocument

Represents a custom document used by a `CustomEditorProvider`.

Custom documents are only used within a given `CustomEditorProvider`. The lifecycle of a `CustomDocument` is managed by the editor. When no more references remain to a `CustomDocument`, it is disposed of.

#### Properties

*   **`uri`**: `Uri`
    The associated uri for this document.

#### Methods

*   **`dispose(): void`**
    Dispose of the custom document.
    This is invoked by the editor when there are no more references to a given `CustomDocument` (for example when all editors associated with the document have been closed.)

    | Parameter   | Description     |
    | :---------- | :-------------- |
    | **Returns** | **Description** |
    | `void`      |                 |

### CustomDocumentBackup

A backup for an `CustomDocument`.

#### Properties

*   **`id`**: `string`
    Unique identifier for the backup.
    This id is passed back to your extension in `openCustomDocument` when opening a custom editor from a backup.

#### Methods

*   **`delete(): void`**
    Delete the current backup.
    This is called by the editor when it is clear the current backup is no longer needed, such as when a new backup is made or when the file is saved.

    | Parameter   | Description     |
    | :---------- | :-------------- |
    | **Returns** | **Description** |
    | `void`      |                 |

### CustomDocumentBackupContext

Additional information used to implement `CustomDocumentBackup`.

#### Properties

*   **`destination`**: `Uri`
    Suggested file location to write the new backup.
    Note that your extension is free to ignore this and use its own strategy for backup.
    If the editor is for a resource from the current workspace, `destination` will point to a file inside `ExtensionContext.storagePath`. The parent folder of `destination` may not exist, so make sure to created it before writing the backup to this location.

### CustomDocumentContentChangeEvent<T>

Event triggered by extensions to signal to the editor that the content of a `CustomDocument` has changed.

See also `CustomEditorProvider.onDidChangeCustomDocument`.

#### Properties

*   **`document`**: `T`
    The document that the change is for.

### CustomDocumentEditEvent<T>

Event triggered by extensions to signal to the editor that an edit has occurred on an `CustomDocument`.

See also `CustomEditorProvider.onDidChangeCustomDocument`.

#### Properties

*   **`document`**: `T`
    The document that the edit is for.
*   **`label?`**: `string`
    Display name describing the edit.
    This will be shown to users in the UI for undo/redo operations.

#### Methods

*   **`redo(): void | Thenable<void>`**
    Redo the edit operation.
    This is invoked by the editor when the user redoes this edit. To implement redo, your extension should restore the document and editor to the state they were in just after this edit was added to the editor's internal edit stack by `onDidChangeCustomDocument`.

    | Parameter             | Description     |
    | :-------------------- | :-------------- |
    | **Returns**           | **Description** |
    | `void` \| `Thenable<void>` |                 |

*   **`undo(): void | Thenable<void>`**
    Undo the edit operation.
    This is invoked by the editor when the user undoes this edit. To implement undo, your extension should restore the document and editor to the state they were in just before this edit was added to the editor's internal edit stack by `onDidChangeCustomDocument`.

    | Parameter             | Description     |
    | :-------------------- | :-------------- |
    | **Returns**           | **Description** |
    | `void` \| `Thenable<void>` |                 |

### CustomDocumentOpenContext

Additional information about the opening custom document.

#### Properties

*   **`backupId`**: `string`
    The id of the backup to restore the document from or `undefined` if there is no backup.
    If this is provided, your extension should restore the editor from the backup instead of reading the file from the user's workspace.
*   **`untitledDocumentData`**: `Uint8Array`
    If the `URI` is an untitled file, this will be populated with the byte data of that file
    If this is provided, your extension should utilize this byte data rather than executing fs APIs on the `URI` passed in

### CustomEditorProvider<T>

Provider for editable custom editors that use a custom document model.

Custom editors use `CustomDocument` as their document model instead of a `TextDocument`. This gives extensions full control over actions such as edit, save, and backup.

You should use this type of custom editor when dealing with binary files or more complex scenarios. For simple text based documents, use `CustomTextEditorProvider` instead.

#### Events

*   **`onDidChangeCustomDocument`**: `Event<CustomDocumentEditEvent<T>>` | `Event<CustomDocumentContentChangeEvent<T>>`
    Signal that an edit has occurred inside a custom editor.

    This event must be fired by your extension whenever an edit happens in a custom editor. An edit can be anything from changing some text, to cropping an image, to reordering a list. Your extension is free to define what an edit is and what data is stored on each edit.

    Firing `onDidChange` causes the editors to be marked as being dirty. This is cleared when the user either saves or reverts the file.

    Editors that support undo/redo must fire a `CustomDocumentEditEvent` whenever an edit happens. This allows users to undo and redo the edit using the editor's standard keyboard shortcuts. The editor will also mark the editor as no longer being dirty if the user undoes all edits to the last saved state.

    Editors that support editing but cannot use the editor's standard undo/redo mechanism must fire a `CustomDocumentContentChangeEvent`. The only way for a user to clear the dirty state of an editor that does not support undo/redo is to either save or revert the file.

    An editor should only ever fire `CustomDocumentEditEvent` events, or only ever fire `CustomDocumentContentChangeEvent` events.

#### Methods

*   **`backupCustomDocument(document: T, context: CustomDocumentBackupContext, cancellation: CancellationToken): Thenable<CustomDocumentBackup>`**
    Back up a dirty custom document.

    Backups are used for hot exit and to prevent data loss. Your backup method should persist the resource in its current state, i.e. with the edits applied. Most commonly this means saving the resource to disk in the `ExtensionContext.storagePath`. When the editor reloads and your custom editor is opened for a resource, your extension should first check to see if any backups exist for the resource. If there is a backup, your extension should load the file contents from there instead of from the resource in the workspace.

    `backup` is triggered approximately one second after the user stops editing the document. If the user rapidly edits the document, `backup` will not be invoked until the editing stops.

    `backup` is not invoked when auto save is enabled (since auto save already persists the resource).

    | Parameter                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
    | :---------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `document`: `T`                           | Document to backup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
    | `context`: `CustomDocumentBackupContext`  | Information that can be used to backup the document.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
    | `cancellation`: `CancellationToken`       | Token that signals the current backup since a new backup is coming in. It is up to your extension to decided how to respond to cancellation. If for example your extension is backing up a large file in an operation that takes time to complete, your extension may decide to finish the ongoing backup rather than cancelling it to ensure that the editor has some valid backup. |

*   **`openCustomDocument(uri: Uri, openContext: CustomDocumentOpenContext, token: CancellationToken): T | Thenable<T>`**
    Create a new document for a given resource.

    `openCustomDocument` is called when the first time an editor for a given resource is opened. The opened document is then passed to `resolveCustomEditor` so that the editor can be shown to the user.

    Already opened `CustomDocument` are re-used if the user opened additional editors. When all editors for a given resource are closed, the `CustomDocument` is disposed of. Opening an editor at this point will trigger another call to `openCustomDocument`.

*   **`resolveCustomEditor(document: T, webviewPanel: WebviewPanel, token: CancellationToken): void | Thenable<void>`**
    Resolve a custom editor for a given resource.

    This is called whenever the user opens a new editor for this `CustomEditorProvider`.

    | Parameter                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

*   **`revertCustomDocument(document: T, cancellation: CancellationToken): Thenable<void>`**
    Revert a custom document to its last saved state.

    This method is invoked by the editor when the user triggers `File: Revert File` in a custom editor. (Note that this is only used using the editor's `File: Revert File` command and not on a git revert of the file).

    To implement revert, the implementer must make sure all editor instances (webviews) for `document` are displaying the document in the same state is saved in. This usually means reloading the file from the workspace.

    | Parameter                           | Description                                           |

    | `cancellation`: `CancellationToken` | Token that signals the revert is no longer required.  |
    | **Returns**                         | **Description**                                       |
    | `Thenable<void>`                    | Thenable signaling that the change has completed.     |

*   **`saveCustomDocument(document: T, cancellation: CancellationToken): Thenable<void>`**
    Save a custom document.

    This method is invoked by the editor when the user saves a custom editor. This can happen when the user triggers save while the custom editor is active, by commands such as `save all`, or by auto save if enabled.

    To implement save, the implementer must persist the custom editor. This usually means writing the file data for the custom document to disk. After save completes, any associated editor instances will no longer be marked as dirty.

    | Parameter                           | Description                                                                                     |

    | `Thenable<void>`                    | Thenable signaling that saving has completed.                                                   |

*   **`saveCustomDocumentAs(document: T, destination: Uri, cancellation: CancellationToken): Thenable<void>`**
    Save a custom document to a different location.

    This method is invoked by the editor when the user triggers 'save as' on a custom editor. The implementer must persist the custom editor to `destination`.

    When the user accepts save as, the current editor is be replaced by an non-dirty editor for the newly saved file.

    | Parameter                           | Description                                           |

    | `destination`: `Uri`                | Location to save to.                                  |
    | `cancellation`: `CancellationToken` | Token that signals the save is no longer required.    |
    | **Returns**                         | **Description**                                       |
    | `Thenable<void>`                    | Thenable signaling that saving has completed.         |

### CustomExecution

Class used to execute an extension callback as a task.

#### Constructors

*   **`new CustomExecution(callback: (resolvedDefinition: TaskDefinition) => Thenable<Pseudoterminal>): CustomExecution`**
    Constructs a `CustomExecution` task object. The callback will be executed when the task is run, at which point the extension should return the `Pseudoterminal` it will "run in". The task should wait to do further execution until `Pseudoterminal.open` is called. Task cancellation should be handled using `Pseudoterminal.close`. When the task is complete fire `Pseudoterminal.onDidClose`.

    | Parameter                                                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
    | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `callback`: (`resolvedDefinition`: `TaskDefinition`) => `Thenable<Pseudoterminal>` | The callback that will be called when the task is started by a user. Any `${}` style variables that were in the task definition will be resolved and passed into the callback as `resolvedDefinition`. |
    | **Returns**                                                                         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                            |

### CustomReadonlyEditorProvider<T>

Provider for readonly custom editors that use a custom document model.

Custom editors use `CustomDocument` as their document model instead of a `TextDocument`.

You should use this type of custom editor when dealing with binary files or more complex scenarios. For simple text based documents, use `CustomTextEditorProvider` instead.

#### Methods

*   **`openCustomDocument(uri: Uri, openContext: CustomDocumentOpenContext, token: CancellationToken): T | Thenable<T>`**
    Create a new document for a given resource.

    `openCustomDocument` is called when the first time an editor for a given resource is opened. The opened document is then passed to `resolveCustomEditor` so that the editor can be shown to the user.

    Already opened `CustomDocument` are re-used if the user opened additional editors. When all editors for a given resource are closed, the `CustomDocument` is disposed of. Opening an editor at this point will trigger another call to `openCustomDocument`.

### CustomTextEditorProvider

Provider for text based custom editors.

Text based custom editors use a `TextDocument` as their data model. This considerably simplifies implementing a custom editor as it allows the editor to handle many common operations such as undo and backup. The provider is responsible for synchronizing text changes between the webview and the `TextDocument`.

#### Methods

*   **`resolveCustomTextEditor(document: TextDocument, webviewPanel: WebviewPanel, token: CancellationToken): void | Thenable<void>`**

### DebugConfigurationProviderTriggerKind

A `DebugConfigurationProviderTriggerKind` specifies when the `provideDebugConfigurations` method of a `DebugConfigurationProvider` is triggered. Currently there are two situations: to provide the initial debug configurations for a newly created `launch.json` or to provide dynamically generated debug configurations when the user asks for them through the UI (e.g. via the "Select and Start Debugging" command). A trigger kind is used when registering a `DebugConfigurationProvider` with `debug.registerDebugConfigurationProvider`.

    Controls whether this session should run without debugging, thus ignoring breakpoints. When this property is not specified, the value from the parent session (if there is one) is used.
*   **`parentSession?`**: `DebugSession`
    When specified the newly created debug session is registered as a "child" session of this "parent" debug session.
*   **`suppressDebugStatusbar?`**: `boolean`

### DocumentDropEditProviderMetadata

Provides additional metadata about how a `DocumentDropEditProvider` works.

#### Properties

*   **`dropMimeTypes`**: `readonly string[]`
    List of `DataTransfer` mime types that the provider can handle.
    This can either be an exact mime type such as `image/png`, or a wildcard pattern such as `image/*`.
    Use `text/uri-list` for resources dropped from the explorer or other tree views in the workbench.
    Use `files` to indicate that the provider should be invoked if any files are present in the `DataTransfer`. Note that `DataTransferFile` entries are only created when dropping content from outside the editor, such as from the operating system.
*   **`providedDropEditKinds?`**: `readonly DocumentDropOrPasteEditKind[]`
    List of kinds that the provider may return in `provideDocumentDropEdits`.
    This is used to filter out providers when a specific kind of edit is requested.

### DocumentDropOrPasteEditKind

Identifies a `DocumentDropEdit` or `DocumentPasteEdit`

#### Static

*   **`Empty`**: `DocumentDropOrPasteEditKind`
*   **`Text`**: `DocumentDropOrPasteEditKind`
    The root kind for basic text edits.
    This kind should be used for edits that insert basic text into the document. A good example of this is an edit that pastes the clipboard text while also updating imports in the file based on the pasted text. For this we could use a kind such as `text.updateImports.someLanguageId`.
    Even though most drop/paste edits ultimately insert text, you should not use `Text` as the base kind for every edit as this is redundant. Instead a more specific kind that describes the type of content being inserted should be used instead. For example, if the edit adds a Markdown link, use `markdown.link` since even though the content being inserted is text, it's more important to know that the edit inserts Markdown syntax.
*   **`TextUpdateImports`**: `DocumentDropOrPasteEditKind`
    Root kind for edits that update imports in a document in addition to inserting text.

#### Constructors

*   **`new DocumentDropOrPasteEditKind(value: string): DocumentDropOrPasteEditKind`**
    Use `DocumentDropOrPasteEditKind.Empty` instead.

    | Parameter                           | Description     |
    | :---------------------------------- | :-------------- |
    | `value`: `string`                   |                 |
    | **Returns**                         | **Description** |
    | `DocumentDropOrPasteEditKind`       |                 |

#### Properties

*   **`value`**: `string`
    The raw string value of the kind.

#### Methods

*   **`append(...parts: string[]): DocumentDropOrPasteEditKind`**
    Create a new kind by appending additional scopes to the current kind.
    Does not modify the current kind.

    | Parameter                           | Description     |

    | **Returns**                         | **Description** |
    | `DocumentDropOrPasteEditKind`       |                 |

*   **`contains(other: DocumentDropOrPasteEditKind): boolean`**
    Checks if `other` is a sub-kind of this `DocumentDropOrPasteEditKind`.
    The kind `"text.plain"` for example contains `"text.plain"` and `"text.plain.list"`, but not `"text"` or `"unicorn.text.plain"`.

    | Parameter                               | Description     |
    | :-------------------------------------- | :-------------- |
    | `other`: `DocumentDropOrPasteEditKind`  | Kind to check.  |
    | **Returns**                             | **Description** |
    | `boolean`                               |                 |

*   **`intersects(other: DocumentDropOrPasteEditKind): boolean`**
    Checks if this kind intersects `other`.
    The kind `"text.plain"` for example intersects `text`, `"text.plain"` and `"text.plain.list"`, but not `"unicorn"`, or `"textUnicorn.plain"`.

    | Parameter                               | Description     |
    | :-------------------------------------- | :-------------- |
    | `other`: `DocumentDropOrPasteEditKind`  | Kind to check.  |
    | **Returns**                             | **Description** |
    | `boolean`                               |                 |

### DocumentFilter

A document filter denotes a document by different properties like the language, the scheme of its resource, or a glob-pattern that is applied to the path.

Example A language filter that applies to typescript files on disk
```json
{ "language": "typescript", "scheme": "file" }
```
Example A language filter that applies to all `package.json` paths
```json
{ "language": "json", "pattern": "**/package.json" }
```

#### Properties

*   **`language?`**: `string`
    A language id, like `typescript`.
*   **`notebookType?`**: `string`
    The type of a notebook, like `jupyter-notebook`. This allows to narrow down on the type of a notebook that a cell document belongs to.
    Note that setting the `notebookType`-property changes how `scheme` and `pattern` are interpreted. When set they are evaluated against the notebook uri, not the document uri.
    Example Match python document inside jupyter notebook that aren't stored yet (untitled)
    ```json
    { "language": "python", "notebookType": "jupyter-notebook", "scheme": "untitled" }
    ```
*   **`pattern?`**: `GlobPattern`
    A glob pattern that is matched on the absolute path of the document. Use a relative pattern to filter documents to a workspace folder.
*   **`scheme?`**: `string`
    A `Uri` scheme, like `file` or `untitled`.

    Optional method which fills in the `DocumentPasteEdit.additionalEdit` before the edit is applied.
    This is called once per edit and should be used if generating the complete edit may take a long time. Resolve can only be used to change `DocumentPasteEdit.insertText` or `DocumentPasteEdit.additionalEdit`.

    | `ProviderResult<T>`          | The resolved paste edit or a thenable that resolves to such. It is OK to return the given `pasteEdit`. If no result is returned, the given `pasteEdit` is used. |

### DocumentPasteProviderMetadata

Provides additional metadata about how a `DocumentPasteEditProvider` works.

#### Properties

*   **`copyMimeTypes?`**: `readonly string[]`
    Mime types that `prepareDocumentPaste` may add on copy.
*   **`pasteMimeTypes?`**: `readonly string[]`
    Mime types that `provideDocumentPasteEdits` should be invoked for.
    This can either be an exact mime type such as `image/png`, or a wildcard pattern such as `image/*`.
    Use `text/uri-list` for resources dropped from the explorer or other tree views in the workbench.
    Use `files` to indicate that the provider should be invoked if any files are present in the `DataTransfer`. Note that `DataTransferFile` entries are only created when pasting content from outside the editor, such as from the operating system.
*   **`providedPasteEditKinds`**: `readonly DocumentDropOrPasteEditKind[]`
    List of kinds that the provider may return in `provideDocumentPasteEdits`.
    This is used to filter out providers when a specific kind of edit is requested.

### DocumentPasteTriggerKind

The reason why paste edits were requested.

#### Enumeration Members

*   **`Automatic`**: `0`
    Pasting was requested as part of a normal paste operation.
*   **`PasteAs`**: `1`
    Pasting was requested by the user with the paste as command.

### DocumentRangeFormattingEditProvider

The document formatting provider interface defines the contract between extensions and the formatting-feature.

#### Methods

*   **`provideDocumentRangeFormattingEdits(document: TextDocument, range: Range, options: FormattingOptions, token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<TextEdit[]>`**
    Provide formatting edits for a range in a document.

    The given range is a hint and providers can decide to format a smaller or larger range. Often this is done by adjusting the start and end of the range to full syntax nodes.

    | `ProviderResult<TextEdit[]>`                | A set of text edits or a thenable that resolves to such. The lack of a result can be signaled by returning `undefined`, `null`, or an empty array.       |

*   **`provideDocumentRangesFormattingEdits(document: TextDocument, ranges: Range[], options: FormattingOptions, token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<TextEdit[]>`**
    Provide formatting edits for multiple ranges in a document.

    This function is optional but allows a formatter to perform faster when formatting only modified ranges or when formatting a large number of selections.

    The given ranges are hints and providers can decide to format a smaller or larger range. Often this is done by adjusting the start and end of the range to full syntax nodes.

### DocumentRangeSemanticTokensProvider

The document range semantic tokens provider interface defines the contract between extensions and semantic tokens.

#### Methods

*   **`provideDocumentRangeSemanticTokens(document: TextDocument, range: Range, token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<SemanticTokens>`**
    See also `provideDocumentSemanticTokens`.

    | Parameter                                    | Description     |
    | :------------------------------------------- | :-------------- |
    | `document`: `TextDocument`                   |                 |
    | `range`: `Range`                             |                 |
    | `token`: `CancellationToken`                 |                 |
    | **Returns**                                  | **Description** |
    | `ProviderResult<SemanticTokens>`             |                 |

### DocumentSelector

A language selector is the combination of one or many language identifiers and language filters.

Note that a document selector that is just a language identifier selects all documents, even those that are not saved on disk. Only use such selectors when a feature works without further context, e.g. without the need to resolve related 'files'.

Example
```javascript
let sel: DocumentSelector = { scheme: 'file', language: 'typescript' };
```

`DocumentSelector`: `DocumentFilter` | `string` | `ReadonlyArray<DocumentFilter | string>`

### DocumentSemanticTokensProvider

The document semantic tokens provider interface defines the contract between extensions and semantic tokens.

#### Events

*   **`onDidChangeSemanticTokens?`**: `Event<void>`
    An optional event to signal that the semantic tokens from this provider have changed.

#### Methods

*   **`provideDocumentSemanticTokens(document: TextDocument, token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<SemanticTokens>`**
    Tokens in a file are represented as an array of integers. The position of each token is expressed relative to the token before it, because most tokens remain stable relative to each other when edits are made in a file.

    In short, each token takes 5 integers to represent, so a specific token `i` in the file consists of the following array indices:
    *   at index `5*i` - `deltaLine`: token line number, relative to the previous token
    *   at index `5*i+1` - `deltaStart`: token start character, relative to the previous token (relative to 0 or the previous token's start if they are on the same line)
    *   at index `5*i+2` - `length`: the length of the token. A token cannot be multiline.
    *   at index `5*i+3` - `tokenType`: will be looked up in `SemanticTokensLegend.tokenTypes`. We currently ask that `tokenType < 65536`.
    *   at index `5*i+4` - `tokenModifiers`: each set bit will be looked up in `SemanticTokensLegend.tokenModifiers`

    ### How to encode tokens
    Here is an example for encoding a file with 3 tokens in a `uint32` array:
    ```javascript
    { line: 2, startChar: 5, length: 3, tokenType: "property", tokenModifiers: ["private", "static"] },
    { line: 2, startChar: 10, length: 4, tokenType: "type", tokenModifiers: [] },
    { line: 5, startChar: 2, length: 7, tokenType: "class", tokenModifiers: [] }
    ```
    1.  First of all, a legend must be devised. This legend must be provided up-front and capture all possible token types. For this example, we will choose the following legend which must be passed in when registering the provider:
        ```javascript
        tokenTypes: ['property', 'type', 'class'],
        tokenModifiers: ['private', 'static']
        ```
    2.  The first transformation step is to encode `tokenType` and `tokenModifiers` as integers using the legend. Token types are looked up by index, so a `tokenType` value of `1` means `tokenTypes[1]`. Multiple token modifiers can be set by using bit flags, so a `tokenModifier` value of `3` is first viewed as binary `0b00000011`, which means `[tokenModifiers[0], tokenModifiers[1]]` because bits 0 and 1 are set.
        Using this legend, the tokens now are:
        ```javascript
        { line: 2, startChar: 5, length: 3, tokenType: 0, tokenModifiers: 3 },
        { line: 2, startChar: 10, length: 4, tokenType: 1, tokenModifiers: 0 },
        { line: 5, startChar: 2, length: 7, tokenType: 2, tokenModifiers: 0 }
        ```
    3.  The next step is to represent each token relative to the previous token in the file. In this case, the second token is on the same line as the first token, so the `startChar` of the second token is made relative to the `startChar` of the first token, so it will be `10 - 5`. The third token is on a different line than the second token, so the `startChar` of the third token will not be altered:
        ```javascript
        { deltaLine: 2, deltaStartChar: 5, length: 3, tokenType: 0, tokenModifiers: 3 },
        { deltaLine: 0, deltaStartChar: 5, length: 4, tokenType: 1, tokenModifiers: 0 },
        { deltaLine: 3, deltaStartChar: 2, length: 7, tokenType: 2, tokenModifiers: 0 }
        ```
    4.  Finally, the last step is to inline each of the 5 fields for a token in a single array, which is a memory friendly representation:
        ```javascript
        // 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
        [  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]
        ```
    See also `SemanticTokensBuilder` for a helper to encode tokens as integers.
    NOTE: When doing edits, it is possible that multiple edits occur until the editor decides to invoke the semantic tokens provider.
    NOTE: If the provider cannot temporarily compute semantic tokens, it can indicate this by throwing an error with the message 'Busy'.

    | Parameter                                    | Description     |
    | :------------------------------------------- | :-------------- |
    | `document`: `TextDocument`                   |                 |
    | `token`: `CancellationToken`                 |                 |
    | **Returns**                                  | **Description** |
    | `ProviderResult<SemanticTokens>`             |                 |

*   **`provideDocumentSemanticTokensEdits(document: TextDocument, previousResultId: string, token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<SemanticTokens | SemanticTokensEdits>`**
    Instead of always returning all the tokens in a file, it is possible for a `DocumentSemanticTokensProvider` to implement this method (`provideDocumentSemanticTokensEdits`) and then return incremental updates to the previously provided semantic tokens.

    ### How tokens change when the document changes
    Suppose that `provideDocumentSemanticTokens` has previously returned the following semantic tokens:
    ```javascript
    // 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
    [  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]
    ```
    Also suppose that after some edits, the new semantic tokens in a file are:
    ```javascript
    // 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
    [  3,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]
    ```
    It is possible to express these new tokens in terms of an edit applied to the previous tokens:
    ```javascript
    [  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ] // old tokens
    [  3,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ] // new tokens
    edit: { start: 0, deleteCount: 1, data: [3] } // replace integer at offset 0 with 3
    ```
    NOTE: If the provider cannot compute `SemanticTokensEdits`, it can "give up" and return all the tokens in the document again.
    NOTE: All edits in `SemanticTokensEdits` contain indices in the old integers array, so they all refer to the previous result state.

    | Parameter                                                            | Description     |

    | `previousResultId`: `string`                                         |                 |
    | `token`: `CancellationToken`                                         |                 |
    | **Returns**                                                          | **Description** |
    | `ProviderResult<SemanticTokens | SemanticTokensEdits>` |                 |

### EvaluatableExpression

An `EvaluatableExpression` represents an expression in a document that can be evaluated by an active debugger or runtime. The result of this evaluation is shown in a tooltip-like widget. If only a range is specified, the expression will be extracted from the underlying document. An optional expression can be used to override the extracted expression. In this case the range is still used to highlight the range in the document.

#### Constructors

#### Methods

*   **`provideEvaluatableExpression(document: TextDocument, position: Position, token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<EvaluatableExpression>`**
    Provide an evaluatable expression for the given document and position. The editor will evaluate this expression in the active debug session and will show the result in the debug hover.

    Note that this event should be used to propagate information about children.
    See also `EventEmitter`

#### Methods

*   **`provideFileDecoration(uri: Uri, token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<FileDecoration>`**
    Provide decorations for a given uri.
    Note that this function is only called when a file gets rendered in the UI. This means a decoration from a descendent that propagates upwards must be signaled to the editor via the `onDidChangeFileDecorations`-event.

### FileDeleteEvent

An event that is fired after files are deleted.

#### Properties

*   **`files`**: `readonly Uri[]`
    The files that got deleted.

### FilePermission

Permissions of a file.

#### Enumeration Members

*   **`Readonly`**: `1`
    The file is readonly.
    Note: All `FileStat` from a `FileSystemProvider` that is registered with the option `isReadonly: true` will be implicitly handled as if `FilePermission.Readonly` is set. As a consequence, it is not possible to have a readonly file system provider registered where some `FileStat` are not readonly.

### FileRenameEvent

An event that is fired after files are renamed.

#### Properties

*   **`files`**: `ReadonlyArray`<{`newUri`: `Uri`, `oldUri`: `Uri`}>

*   **`mtime`**: `number`
    The modification timestamp in milliseconds elapsed since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.
    Note: If the file changed, it is important to provide an updated `mtime` that advanced from the previous value. Otherwise there may be optimizations in place that will not show the updated file contents in an editor for example.
*   **`permissions?`**: `FilePermission`
    The permissions of the file, e.g. whether the file is readonly.
    Note: This value might be a bitmask, e.g. `FilePermission.Readonly | FilePermission.Other`.
*   **`size`**: `number`
    The size in bytes.
    Note: If the file changed, it is important to provide an updated size. Otherwise there may be optimizations in place that will not show the updated file contents in an editor for example.
*   **`type`**: `FileType`
    The type of the file, e.g. is a regular file, a directory, or symbolic link to a file.
    Note: This value might be a bitmask, e.g. `FileType.File | FileType.SymbolicLink`.

### FileSystem

The file system interface exposes the editor's built-in and contributed file system providers. It allows extensions to work with files from the local disk as well as files from remote places, like the remote extension host or ftp-servers.

Note that an instance of this interface is available as `workspace.fs`.

#### Properties

*   **`code`**: `string`
    A code that identifies this error.
    Possible values are names of errors, like `FileNotFound`, or `Unknown` for unspecified errors.

### FileSystemProvider

The filesystem provider defines what the editor needs to read, write, discover, and to manage files and folders. It allows extensions to serve files from remote places, like ftp-servers, and to seamlessly integrate those into the editor.

*   Note 1: The filesystem provider API works with `uris` and assumes hierarchical paths, e.g. `foo:/my/path` is a child of `foo:/my/` and a parent of `foo:/my/path/deeper`.
*   Note 2: There is an activation event `onFileSystem:<scheme>` that fires when a file or folder is being accessed.
*   Note 3: The word 'file' is often used to denote all kinds of files, e.g. folders, symbolic links, and regular files.

#### Events

*   **`onDidChangeFile`**: `Event<FileChangeEvent[]>`
    An event to signal that a resource has been created, changed, or deleted. This event should fire for resources that are being watched by clients of this provider.
    Note: It is important that the metadata of the file that changed provides an updated `mtime` that advanced from the previous value in the `stat` and a correct `size` value. Otherwise there may be optimizations in place that will not show the change in an editor for example.

#### Methods

*   **`copy(source: Uri, destination: Uri, options: {overwrite: boolean}): void | Thenable<void>`**
    Copy files or folders. Implementing this function is optional but it will speedup the copy operation.
    *   @throws - `FileNotFound` when `source` doesn't exist.
    *   @throws - `FileNotFound` when parent of `destination` doesn't exist, e.g. no `mkdirp`-logic required.
    *   @throws - `FileExists` when `destination` exists and when the `overwrite` option is not true.
    *   @throws - `NoPermissions` when permissions aren't sufficient.

*   **`watch(uri: Uri, options: {excludes: readonly string[], recursive: boolean}): Disposable`**
    Subscribes to file change events in the file or folder denoted by `uri`. For folders, the option `recursive` indicates whether subfolders, sub-subfolders, etc. should be watched for file changes as well. With `recursive: false`, only changes to the files that are direct children of the folder should trigger an event.
    The `excludes` array is used to indicate paths that should be excluded from file watching. It is typically derived from the `files.watcherExclude` setting that is configurable by the user. Each entry can be be:
    *   the absolute path to exclude
    *   a relative path to exclude (for example `build/output`)
    *   a simple glob pattern (for example `**/build`, `output/**`)
    It is the file system provider's job to call `onDidChangeFile` for every change given these rules. No event should be emitted for files that match any of the provided `excludes`.

    | `scope`: `EnvironmentVariableScope`     | The scope to which the environment variable collection applies to.  If a scope parameter is omitted, collection applicable to all relevant scopes for that parameter is returned. For instance, if the 'workspaceFolder' parameter is not specified, the collection that applies across all workspace folders will be returned. |
    | **Returns**                             | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### GlobPattern

A file glob pattern to match file paths against. This can either be a glob pattern string (like `**/*.{ts,js}` or `*.{ts,js}`) or a `RelativePattern`.

Glob patterns can have the following syntax:
*   `*` to match zero or more characters in a path segment
*   `?` to match on one character in a path segment
*   `**` to match any number of path segments, including none
*   `{}` to group conditions (e.g. `**/*.{ts,js}` matches all TypeScript and JavaScript files)
*   `[]` to declare a range of characters to match in a path segment (e.g., `example.[0-9]` to match on `example.0`, `example.1`, ...)
*   `[!...]` to negate a range of characters to match in a path segment (e.g., `example.[!0-9]` to match on `example.a`, `example.b`, but not `example.0`)

Note: a backslash (`\`) is not valid within a glob pattern. If you have an existing file path to match against, consider to use the `RelativePattern` support that takes care of converting any backslash into slash. Otherwise, make sure to convert any backslash to slash when creating the glob pattern.

`GlobPattern`: `string` | `RelativePattern`

    Note that this property can be set late during resolving of inlay hints.
*   **`location?`**: `Location`
    An optional source code location that represents this label part.
    The editor will use this location for the hover and for code navigation features: This part will become a clickable link that resolves to the definition of the symbol at the given location (not necessarily the location itself), it shows the hover that shows at the given location, and it shows a context menu with further code navigation commands.
    Note that this property can be set late during resolving of inlay hints.
*   **`tooltip?`**: `string` | `MarkdownString`
    The tooltip text when you hover over this label part.

### InlineCompletionContext

Provides information about the context in which an inline completion was requested.

#### Properties

*   **`selectedCompletionInfo`**: `SelectedCompletionInfo`
    Provides information about the currently selected item in the autocomplete widget if it is visible.
    If set, provided inline completions must extend the text of the selected item and use the same range, otherwise they are not shown as preview. As an example, if the document text is `console.` and the selected item is `.log` replacing the `.` in the document, the inline completion must also replace `.` and start with `.log`, for example `.log()`.
    Inline completion providers are requested again whenever the selected item changes.
*   **`triggerKind`**: `InlineCompletionTriggerKind`
    Describes how the inline completion was triggered.

### InlineCompletionItem

An inline completion item represents a text snippet that is proposed inline to complete text that is being typed.

See also `InlineCompletionItemProvider.provideInlineCompletionItems`

    The text to replace the range with. Must be set. Is used both for the preview and the accept operation.
*   **`range?`**: `Range`
    The range to replace. Must begin and end on the same line.
    Prefer replacements over insertions to provide a better experience when the user deletes typed text.

### InlineCompletionItemProvider

The inline completion item provider interface defines the contract between extensions and the inline completion feature.

Providers are asked for completions either explicitly by a user gesture or implicitly when typing.

#### Methods

*   **`provideInlineCompletionItems(document: TextDocument, position: Position, context: InlineCompletionContext, token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<InlineCompletionList | InlineCompletionItem[]>`**
    Provides inline completion items for the given position and document.
    If inline completions are enabled, this method will be called whenever the user stopped typing.
    It will also be called when the user explicitly triggers inline completions or explicitly asks for the next or previous inline completion. In that case, all available inline completions should be returned.
    `context.triggerKind` can be used to distinguish between these scenarios.

### InlineValue

Inline value information can be provided by different means:
*   directly as a text value (class `InlineValueText`).
*   as a name to use for a variable lookup (class `InlineValueVariableLookup`)
*   as an evaluatable expression (class `InlineValueEvaluatableExpression`)
The `InlineValue` types combines all inline value types into one type.

`InlineValue`: `InlineValueText` | `InlineValueVariableLookup` | `InlineValueEvaluatableExpression`

### InlineValueContext

A value-object that contains contextual information when requesting inline values from a `InlineValuesProvider`.

#### Properties

*   **`frameId`**: `number`
    The stack frame (as a DAP Id) where the execution has stopped.
*   **`stoppedLocation`**: `Range`
    The document range where execution has stopped. Typically the end position of the range denotes the line where the inline values are shown.

### InlineValueEvaluatableExpression

Provide an inline value through an expression evaluation. If only a range is specified, the expression will be extracted from the underlying document. An optional expression can be used to override the extracted expression.

#### Constructors

*   **`new InlineValueEvaluatableExpression(range: Range, expression?: string): InlineValueEvaluatableExpression`**
    Creates a new `InlineValueEvaluatableExpression` object.

    | Parameter                               | Description                                                                                      |

#### Properties

*   **`expression?`**: `string`
    If specified the expression overrides the extracted expression.
*   **`range`**: `Range`
    The document range for which the inline value applies. The range is used to extract the evaluatable expression from the underlying document.

### InlineValuesProvider

The inline values provider interface defines the contract between extensions and the editor's debugger inline values feature. In this contract the provider returns inline value information for a given document range and the editor shows this information in the editor at the end of lines.

#### Events

*   **`onDidChangeInlineValues?`**: `Event<void>`
    An optional event to signal that inline values have changed.
    See also `EventEmitter`

#### Methods

*   **`provideInlineValues(document: TextDocument, viewPort: Range, context: InlineValueContext, token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<InlineValue[]>`**
    Provide "inline value" information for a given document and range. The editor calls this method whenever debugging stops in the given document. The returned inline values information is rendered in the editor at the end of lines.

    | Parameter                                  | Description                                                                                                                                       |

    If specified the name of the variable to look up.

### InputBox

A concrete `QuickInput` to let the user input a text value.

Note that in many cases the more convenient `window.showInputBox` is easier to use. `window.createInputBox` should be used when `window.showInputBox` does not offer the required flexibility.

#### Events

*   **`onDidAccept`**: `Event<void>`
    An event signaling when the user indicated acceptance of the input value.
*   **`onDidChangeValue`**: `Event<string>`
    An event signaling when the value has changed.
*   **`onDidHide`**: `Event<void>`
    An event signaling when this input UI is hidden.
    There are several reasons why this UI might have to be hidden and the extension will be notified through `QuickInput.onDidHide`. (Examples include: an explicit call to `QuickInput.hide`, the user pressing Esc, some other input UI opening, etc.)
*   **`onDidTriggerButton`**: `Event<QuickInputButton>`
    An event signaling when a button was triggered.

#### Properties

*   **`busy`**: `boolean`
    If the UI should show a progress indicator. Defaults to `false`.
    Change this to `true`, e.g., while loading more data or validating user input.
*   **`buttons`**: `readonly QuickInputButton[]`
    Buttons for actions in the UI.
*   **`enabled`**: `boolean`
    If the UI should allow for user input. Defaults to `true`.
    Change this to `false`, e.g., while validating user input or loading data for the next step in user input.
*   **`ignoreFocusOut`**: `boolean`
    If the UI should stay open even when loosing UI focus. Defaults to `false`. This setting is ignored on iPad and is always `false`.
*   **`password`**: `boolean`
    If the input value should be hidden. Defaults to `false`.
*   **`placeholder`**: `string`
    Optional placeholder shown when no value has been input.
*   **`prompt`**: `string`
    An optional prompt text providing some ask or explanation to the user.
*   **`step`**: `number`
    An optional current step count.
*   **`title`**: `string`
    An optional title.
*   **`totalSteps`**: `number`
    An optional total step count.
*   **`validationMessage`**: `string` | `InputBoxValidationMessage`
    An optional validation message indicating a problem with the current input value. By returning a string, the `InputBox` will use a default `InputBoxValidationSeverity` of `Error`. Returning `undefined` clears the validation message.
*   **`value`**: `string`
    Current input value.
*   **`valueSelection`**: `readonly [number, number]`
    Selection range in the input value. Defined as tuple of two number where the first is the inclusive start index and the second the exclusive end index. When `undefined` the whole pre-filled value will be selected, when empty (start equals end) only the cursor will be set, otherwise the defined range will be selected.
    This property does not get updated when the user types or makes a selection, but it can be updated by the extension.

#### Methods

*   **`dispose(): void`**
    Dispose of this input UI and any associated resources. If it is still visible, it is first hidden. After this call the input UI is no longer functional and no additional methods or properties on it should be accessed. Instead a new input UI should be created.

    | Parameter   | Description     |
    | :---------- | :-------------- |
    | **Returns** | **Description** |
    | `void`      |                 |

*   **`hide(): void`**
    Hides this input UI. This will also fire an `QuickInput.onDidHide` event.

    | Parameter   | Description     |
    | :---------- | :-------------- |
    | **Returns** | **Description** |
    | `void`      |                 |

*   **`show(): void`**
    Makes the input UI visible in its current configuration. Any other input UI will first fire an `QuickInput.onDidHide` event.

    | Parameter   | Description     |
    | :---------- | :-------------- |
    | **Returns** | **Description** |
    | `void`      |                 |

### InputBoxOptions

### LanguageModelChat

Represents a language model for making chat requests.

See also `lm.selectChatModels`

#### Properties

*   **`family`**: `string`
    Opaque family-name of the language model. Values might be `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt4`, `phi2`, or `llama` but they are defined by extensions contributing languages and subject to change.
*   **`id`**: `string`

*   **`maxInputTokens`**: `number`
    The maximum number of tokens that can be sent to the model in a single request.
*   **`name`**: `string`
    Human-readable name of the language model.
*   **`vendor`**: `string`
    A well-known identifier of the vendor of the language model. An example is `copilot`, but values are defined by extensions contributing chat models and need to be looked up with them.
*   **`version`**: `string`
    Opaque version string of the model. This is defined by the extension contributing the language model and subject to change.

#### Methods

*   **`countTokens(text: string | LanguageModelChatMessage, token?: CancellationToken): Thenable<number>`**
    Count the number of tokens in a message using the model specific tokenizer-logic.

    | Parameter                                       | Description                                                           |
    | :---------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `text`: `string` \| `LanguageModelChatMessage`  | A string or a message instance.                                       |
    | `token?`: `CancellationToken`                   | Optional cancellation token. See `CancellationTokenSource` for how to create one. |
    | **Returns**                                     | **Description**                                                       |
    | `Thenable<number>`                              | A thenable that resolves to the number of tokens.                     |

*   **`sendRequest(messages: LanguageModelChatMessage[], options?: LanguageModelChatRequestOptions, token?: CancellationToken): Thenable<LanguageModelChatResponse>`**
    Make a chat request using a language model.

    Note that language model use may be subject to access restrictions and user consent. Calling this function for the first time (for an extension) will show a consent dialog to the user and because of that this function must only be called in response to a user action! Extensions can use `LanguageModelAccessInformation.canSendRequest` to check if they have the necessary permissions to make a request.

    This function will return a rejected promise if making a request to the language model is not possible. Reasons for this can be:
    *   user consent not given, see `NoPermissions`
    *   model does not exist anymore, see `NotFound`
    *   quota limits exceeded, see `Blocked`
    *   other issues in which case extension must check [`LanguageModelError.cause` LanguageModelError.cause](#LanguageModelError.cause-LanguageModelError.cause)

    An extension can make use of language model tool calling by passing a set of tools to `LanguageModelChatRequestOptions.tools`. The language model will return a `LanguageModelToolCallPart` and the extension can invoke the tool and make another request with the result.

    | `token?`: `CancellationToken`                             | A cancellation token which controls the request. See `CancellationTokenSource` for how to create one.                                                                   |
    | **Returns**                                               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                         |
    | `Thenable<LanguageModelChatResponse>`                     | A thenable that resolves to a `LanguageModelChatResponse`. The promise will reject when the request couldn't be made.                                                     |

*   **`modelOptions?`**:
    A set of options that control the behavior of the language model. These options are specific to the language model and need to be lookup in the respective documentation.
*   **`toolMode?`**: `LanguageModelChatToolMode`
    The tool-selecting mode to use. `LanguageModelChatToolMode.Auto` by default.
*   **`tools?`**: `LanguageModelChatTool[]`
    An optional list of tools that are available to the language model. These could be registered tools available via `lm.tools`, or private tools that are just implemented within the calling extension.
    If the LLM requests to call one of these tools, it will return a `LanguageModelToolCallPart` in `LanguageModelChatResponse.stream`. It's the caller's responsibility to invoke the tool. If it's a tool registered in `lm.tools`, that means calling `lm.invokeTool`.
    Then, the tool result can be provided to the LLM by creating an `Assistant`-type `LanguageModelChatMessage` with a `LanguageModelToolCallPart`, followed by a `User`-type message with a `LanguageModelToolResultPart`.

### LanguageModelChatResponse

Represents a language model response.

See also `ChatRequest`

#### Properties

*   **`stream`**: `AsyncIterable<unknown>`
    An async iterable that is a stream of text and tool-call parts forming the overall response. A `LanguageModelTextPart` is part of the assistant's response to be shown to the user. A `LanguageModelToolCallPart` is a request from the language model to call a tool. The latter will only be returned if tools were passed in the request via `LanguageModelChatRequestOptions.tools`. The `unknown`-type is used as a placeholder for future parts, like image data parts.

    Note that this stream will error when during data receiving an error occurs. Consumers of the stream should handle the errors accordingly.

    To cancel the stream, the consumer can cancel the token that was used to make the request or break from the for-loop.

    Example
    ```javascript
    try {
        // consume stream
        for await (const chunk of response.stream) {
            if (chunk instanceof LanguageModelTextPart) {
                console.log('TEXT', chunk);
            } else if (chunk instanceof LanguageModelToolCallPart) {
                console.log('TOOL CALL', chunk);
            }
        }
    } catch (e) {
        // stream ended with an error
        console.error(e);
    }
    ```
*   **`text`**: `AsyncIterable<string>`
    This is equivalent to filtering everything except for text parts from a `LanguageModelChatResponse.stream`.
    See also `LanguageModelChatResponse.stream`

#### Properties

*   **`baseUri?`**: `Uri`
    Uri that relative paths are resolved relative to.
    If the `baseUri` ends with `/`, it is considered a directory and relative paths in the markdown are resolved relative to that directory:
    ```javascript
    const md = new vscode.MarkdownString(`[link](./file.js)`);
    md.baseUri = vscode.Uri.file('/path/to/dir/');
    // Here 'link' in the rendered markdown resolves to '/path/to/dir/file.js'
    ```
    If the `baseUri` is a file, relative paths in the markdown are resolved relative to the parent dir of that file:
    ```javascript
    const md = new vscode.MarkdownString(`[link](./file.js)`);
    md.baseUri = vscode.Uri.file('/path/to/otherFile.js');
    // Here 'link' in the rendered markdown resolves to '/path/to/file.js'
    ```
*   **`isTrusted?`**: `boolean` | {`enabledCommands`: `readonly string[]`}
    Indicates that this markdown string is from a trusted source. Only trusted markdown supports links that execute commands, e.g. `[Run it](command:myCommandId)`.
    Defaults to `false` (commands are disabled).
*   **`supportHtml?`**: `boolean`
    Indicates that this markdown string can contain raw html tags. Defaults to `false`.
    When `supportHtml` is `false`, the markdown renderer will strip out any raw html tags that appear in the markdown text. This means you can only use markdown syntax for rendering.
    When `supportHtml` is `true`, the markdown render will also allow a safe subset of html tags and attributes to be rendered. See https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/6d2920473c6f13759c978dd89104c4270a83422d/src/vs/base/browser/markdownRenderer.ts#L296 for a list of all supported tags and attributes.
*   **`supportThemeIcons?`**: `boolean`
    Indicates that this markdown string can contain `ThemeIcon`s, e.g. `$(zap)`.
*   **`value`**: `string`
    The markdown string.

### NotebookController

A notebook controller represents an entity that can execute notebook cells. This is often referred to as a kernel.

There can be multiple controllers and the editor will let users choose which controller to use for a certain notebook. The `notebookType`-property defines for what kind of notebooks a controller is for and the `updateNotebookAffinity`-function allows controllers to set a preference for specific notebook documents. When a controller has been selected its `onDidChangeSelectedNotebooks`-event fires.

When a cell is being run the editor will invoke the `executeHandler` and a controller is expected to create and finalize a notebook cell execution. However, controllers are also free to create executions by themselves.

#### Events

*   **`onDidChangeSelectedNotebooks`**: `Event`<{`notebook`: `NotebookDocument`, `selected`: `boolean`}>
    An event that fires whenever a controller has been selected or un-selected for a notebook document.
    There can be multiple controllers for a notebook and in that case a controllers needs to be selected. This is a user gesture and happens either explicitly or implicitly when interacting with a notebook for which a controller was suggested. When possible, the editor suggests a controller that is most likely to be selected.
    Note that controller selection is persisted (by the controllers id) and restored as soon as a controller is re-created or as a notebook is opened.

#### Properties

*   **`description?`**: `string`
    The human-readable description which is rendered less prominent.
*   **`detail?`**: `string`
    The human-readable detail which is rendered less prominent.
*   **`executeHandler`**: (`cells`: `NotebookCell[]`, `notebook`: `NotebookDocument`, `controller`: `NotebookController`) => `void` | `Thenable<void>`
    The execute handler is invoked when the run gestures in the UI are selected, e.g Run Cell, Run All, Run Selection etc. The execute handler is responsible for creating and managing execution-objects.

    | Parameter                         | Description     |
    | :-------------------------------- | :-------------- |
    | `cells`: `NotebookCell[]`         |                 |
    | `notebook`: `NotebookDocument`    |                 |
    | `controller`: `NotebookController` |                 |
    | **Returns**                       | **Description** |
    | `void` \| `Thenable<void>`        |                 |
*   **`id`**: `string`
    The identifier of this notebook controller.
    Note that controllers are remembered by their identifier and that extensions should use stable identifiers across sessions.
*   **`interruptHandler?`**: (`notebook`: `NotebookDocument`) => `void` | `Thenable<void>`
    Optional interrupt handler.
    By default cell execution is canceled via tokens. Cancellation tokens require that a controller can keep track of its execution so that it can cancel a specific execution at a later point. Not all scenarios allow for that, eg. REPL-style controllers often work by interrupting whatever is currently running. For those cases the interrupt handler exists - it can be thought of as the equivalent of SIGINT or Control+C in terminals.
    Note that supporting cancellation tokens is preferred and that interrupt handlers should only be used when tokens cannot be supported.

    | Parameter                   | Description     |
    | :-------------------------- | :-------------- |
    | `notebook`: `NotebookDocument` |                 |
    | **Returns**                 | **Description** |
    | `void` \| `Thenable<void>`  |                 |
*   **`label`**: `string`
    The human-readable label of this notebook controller.
*   **`notebookType`**: `string`
    The notebook type this controller is for.
*   **`supportedLanguages?`**: `string[]`
    An array of language identifiers that are supported by this controller. Any language identifier from `getLanguages` is possible. When falsy all languages are supported.
    Samples:
    ```javascript
    // support JavaScript and TypeScript
    myController.supportedLanguages = ['javascript', 'typescript'];
    // support all languages
    myController.supportedLanguages = undefined; // falsy
    myController.supportedLanguages = []; // falsy
    ```
*   **`supportsExecutionOrder?`**: `boolean`
    Whether this controller supports execution order so that the editor can render placeholders for them.

#### Methods

*   **`createNotebookCellExecution(cell: NotebookCell): NotebookCellExecution`**
    Create a cell execution task.
    Note that there can only be one execution per cell at a time and that an error is thrown if a cell execution is created while another is still active.
    This should be used in response to the `executionHandler` being called or when cell execution has been started else, e.g when a cell was already executing or when cell execution was triggered from another source.

    | Parameter                 | Description                                           |

### NotebookDocumentContentOptions

Notebook content options define what parts of a notebook are persisted. Note

For instance, a notebook serializer can opt-out of saving outputs and in that case the editor doesn't mark a notebooks as dirty when its output has changed.

#### Properties

*   **`transientCellMetadata?`**:
    Controls if a cell metadata property change event will trigger notebook document content change events and if it will be used in the diff editor, defaults to `false`. If the content provider doesn't persist a metadata property in the file document, it should be set to `true`.
*   **`transientDocumentMetadata?`**:
    Controls if a document metadata property change event will trigger notebook document content change event and if it will be used in the diff editor, defaults to `false`. If the content provider doesn't persist a metadata property in the file document, it should be set to `true`.
*   **`transientOutputs?`**: `boolean`
    Controls if output change events will trigger notebook document content change events and if it will be used in the diff editor, defaults to `false`. If the content provider doesn't persist the outputs in the file document, this should be set to `true`.

### NotebookDocumentShowOptions

Represents options to configure the behavior of showing a notebook document in an notebook editor.

#### Properties

*   **`waitUntil(thenable: Thenable<WorkspaceEdit>): void`**
    Allows to pause the event loop and to apply workspace edit. Edits of subsequent calls to this function will be applied in order. The edits will be ignored if concurrent modifications of the notebook document happened.
    Note: This function can only be called during event dispatch and not in an asynchronous manner:
    ```javascript
    workspace.onWillSaveNotebookDocument(event => {
        // async, will *throw* an error
        setTimeout(() => event.waitUntil(promise));
        // sync, OK
        event.waitUntil(promise);
    });
    ```

    | `NotebookData` \| `Thenable<NotebookData>`   | Notebook data or a thenable that resolves to such.                    |

*   **`serializeNotebook(data: NotebookData, token: CancellationToken): Uint8Array | Thenable<Uint8Array>`**
    Serialize notebook data into file contents.

### OpenDialogOptions

Options to configure the behaviour of a file open dialog.
*   Note 1: On Windows and Linux, a file dialog cannot be both a file selector and a folder selector, so if you set both `canSelectFiles` and `canSelectFolders` to `true` on these platforms, a folder selector will be shown.
*   Note 2: Explicitly setting `canSelectFiles` and `canSelectFolders` to `false` is futile and the editor then silently adjusts the options to select files.

#### Properties

*   **`canSelectFiles?`**: `boolean`
    Allow to select files, defaults to `true`.
*   **`canSelectFolders?`**: `boolean`
    Allow to select folders, defaults to `false`.
*   **`canSelectMany?`**: `boolean`
    Allow to select many files or folders.
*   **`defaultUri?`**: `Uri`
    The resource the dialog shows when opened.
*   **`filters?`**:
    A set of file filters that are used by the dialog. Each entry is a human-readable label, like "TypeScript", and an array of extensions, for example:
    ```javascript
    {
        'Images': ['png', 'jpg'],
        'TypeScript': ['ts', 'tsx']
    }
    ```
*   **`openLabel?`**: `string`
    A human-readable string for the open button.
*   **`title?`**: `string`
    Dialog title.
    This parameter might be ignored, as not all operating systems display a title on open dialogs (for example, macOS).

### OutputChannel

An output channel is a container for readonly textual information.

To get an instance of an `OutputChannel` use `createOutputChannel`.

#### Properties

*   **`name`**: `string`

    | Parameter     | Description                                                                 |
    | :------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `value`: `T`  | A progress item, like a message and/or an report on how much work finished |
    | **Returns**   | **Description**                                                             |
    | `void`        |                                                                             |

### ProgressLocation

A location in the editor at which progress information can be shown. It depends on the location how progress is visually represented.

#### Enumeration Members

*   **`SourceControl`**: `1`
    Show progress for the source control viewlet, as overlay for the icon and as progress bar inside the viewlet (when visible). Neither supports cancellation nor discrete progress nor a label to describe the operation.
*   **`Window`**: `10`
    Show progress in the status bar of the editor. Neither supports cancellation nor discrete progress. Supports rendering of theme icons via the `$(<name>)`-syntax in the progress label.
*   **`Notification`**: `15`
    Show progress as notification with an optional cancel button. Supports to show infinite and discrete progress but does not support rendering of icons.

### ProgressOptions

Value-object describing where and how progress should show.

#### Properties

*   **`cancellable?`**: `boolean`
    Controls if a cancel button should show to allow the user to cancel the long running operation. Note that currently only `ProgressLocation.Notification` is supporting to show a cancel button.
*   **`location`**: `ProgressLocation` | {`viewId`: `string`}
    The location at which progress should show.
*   **`title?`**: `string`
    A human-readable string which will be used to describe the operation.

### ProviderResult<T>

A provider result represents the values a provider, like the `HoverProvider`, may return. For once this is the actual result type `T`, like `Hover`, or a thenable that resolves to that type `T`. In addition, `null` and `undefined` can be returned - either directly or from a thenable.

The snippets below are all valid implementations of the `HoverProvider`:
```javascript
let a: HoverProvider = {
    provideHover(doc, pos, token): ProviderResult<Hover> {
        return new Hover('Hello World');
    }
};
let b: HoverProvider = {
    provideHover(doc, pos, token): ProviderResult<Hover> {
        return new Promise(resolve => {
            resolve(new Hover('Hello World'));
        });
    }
};
let c: HoverProvider = {
    provideHover(doc, pos, token): ProviderResult<Hover> {
        return; // undefined
    }
};
```

`ProviderResult`: `T` | `undefined` | `null` | `Thenable<T | undefined | null>`

### Pseudoterminal

Defines the interface of a terminal pty, enabling extensions to control a terminal.

#### Events

*   **`onDidChangeName?`**: `Event<string>`
    An event that when fired allows changing the name of the terminal.
    Events fired before `Pseudoterminal.open` is called will be be ignored.
    Example: Change the terminal name to "My new terminal".
    ```javascript
    const writeEmitter = new vscode.EventEmitter<string>();
    const changeNameEmitter = new vscode.EventEmitter<string>();
    const pty: vscode.Pseudoterminal = {
        onDidWrite: writeEmitter.event,
        onDidChangeName: changeNameEmitter.event,
        open: () => changeNameEmitter.fire('My new terminal'),
        close: () => {}
    };
    vscode.window.createTerminal({ name: 'My terminal', pty });
    ```
*   **`onDidClose?`**: `Event<number | void>`
    An event that when fired will signal that the pty is closed and dispose of the terminal.
    Events fired before `Pseudoterminal.open` is called will be be ignored.
    A number can be used to provide an exit code for the terminal. Exit codes must be positive and a non-zero exit codes signals failure which shows a notification for a regular terminal and allows dependent tasks to proceed when used with the `CustomExecution` API.
    Example: Exit the terminal when "y" is pressed, otherwise show a notification.
    ```javascript
    const writeEmitter = new vscode.EventEmitter<string>();
    const closeEmitter = new vscode.EventEmitter<void>();
    const pty: vscode.Pseudoterminal = {
        onDidWrite: writeEmitter.event,
        onDidClose: closeEmitter.event,
        open: () => writeEmitter.fire('Press y to exit successfully'),
        close: () => {},
        handleInput: data => {
            if (data !== 'y') {
                vscode.window.showInformationMessage('Something went wrong');
            }
            closeEmitter.fire();
        }
    };
    const terminal = vscode.window.createTerminal({ name: 'Exit example', pty });
    terminal.show(true);
    ```
*   **`onDidOverrideDimensions?`**: `Event<TerminalDimensions>`
    An event that when fired allows overriding the dimensions of the terminal. Note that when set, the overridden dimensions will only take effect when they are lower than the actual dimensions of the terminal (ie. there will never be a scroll bar). Set to `undefined` for the terminal to go back to the regular dimensions (fit to the size of the panel).
    Events fired before `Pseudoterminal.open` is called will be be ignored.
    Example: Override the dimensions of a terminal to 20 columns and 10 rows
    ```javascript
    const dimensionsEmitter = new vscode.EventEmitter<vscode.TerminalDimensions>();
    const pty: vscode.Pseudoterminal = {
        onDidWrite: writeEmitter.event,
        onDidOverrideDimensions: dimensionsEmitter.event,
        open: () => {
            dimensionsEmitter.fire({ columns: 20, rows: 10 });
        },
        close: () => {}
    };
    vscode.window.createTerminal({ name: 'My terminal', pty });
    ```
*   **`onDidWrite`**: `Event<string>`
    An event that when fired will write data to the terminal. Unlike `Terminal.sendText` which sends text to the underlying child pseudo-device (the child), this will write the text to parent pseudo-device (the terminal itself).
    Note writing `\n` will just move the cursor down 1 row, you need to write `\r` as well to move the cursor to the left-most cell.
    Events fired before `Pseudoterminal.open` is called will be be ignored.
    Example: Write red text to the terminal
    ```javascript
    const writeEmitter = new vscode.EventEmitter<string>();
    const pty: vscode.Pseudoterminal = {
        onDidWrite: writeEmitter.event,
        open: () => writeEmitter.fire('\x1b[31mHello world\x1b[0m'),
        close: () => {}
    };
    vscode.window.createTerminal({ name: 'My terminal', pty });
    ```
    Example: Move the cursor to the 10th row and 20th column and write an asterisk
    ```javascript
    writeEmitter.fire('\x1b[10;20H*');
    ```

#### Methods

*   **`close(): void`**
    Implement to handle when the terminal is closed by an act of the user.

    | Parameter   | Description     |
    | :---------- | :-------------- |
    | **Returns** | **Description** |
    | `void`      |                 |

*   **`handleInput(data: string): void`**
    Implement to handle incoming keystrokes in the terminal or when an extension calls `Terminal.sendText`. `data` contains the keystrokes/text serialized into their corresponding VT sequence representation.

    | Parameter         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
    | :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `data`: `string`  | The incoming data.  Example: Echo input in the terminal. The sequence for enter (`\r`) is translated to CRLF to go to a new line and move the cursor to the start of the line.   ```javascript const writeEmitter = new vscode.EventEmitter<string>(); const pty: vscode.Pseudoterminal = { onDidWrite: writeEmitter.event, open: () => {}, close: () => {}, handleInput: data => writeEmitter.fire(data === '\r' ? '\r\n' : data) }; vscode.window.createTerminal({ name: 'Local echo', pty }); ``` |
    | **Returns**       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
    | `void`            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

*   **`open(initialDimensions: TerminalDimensions): void`**
    Implement to handle when the pty is open and ready to start firing events.

    | Parameter                         | Description                                                                                                       |
    | :-------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `initialDimensions`: `TerminalDimensions` | The dimensions of the terminal, this will be `undefined` if the terminal panel has not been opened before this is called. |
    | **Returns**                       | **Description**                                                                                                   |
    | `void`                            |                                                                                                                   |

*   **`setDimensions(dimensions: TerminalDimensions): void`**
    Implement to handle when the number of rows and columns that fit into the terminal panel changes, for example when font size changes or when the panel is resized. The initial state of a terminal's dimensions should be treated as `undefined` until this is triggered as the size of a terminal isn't known until it shows up in the user interface.
    When dimensions are overridden by `onDidOverrideDimensions`, `setDimensions` will continue to be called with the regular panel dimensions, allowing the extension continue to react dimension changes.

    | Parameter                   | Description           |
    | :-------------------------- | :-------------------- |
    | `dimensions`: `TerminalDimensions` | The new dimensions.   |
    | **Returns**                 | **Description**       |
    | `void`                      |                       |

### QuickDiffProvider

A quick diff provider provides a uri to the original state of a modified resource. The editor will use this information to render ad'hoc diffs within the text.

#### Methods

*   **`provideOriginalResource(uri: Uri, token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<Uri>`**
    Provide a `Uri` to the original resource of any given resource uri.

    | Parameter                     | Description                                                                   |

    | `token`: `CancellationToken`  | A cancellation token.                                                         |
    | **Returns**                   | **Description**                                                               |
    | `ProviderResult<Uri>`         | A thenable that resolves to uri of the matching original resource.            |

### QuickInput

A light-weight user input UI that is initially not visible. After configuring it through its properties the extension can make it visible by calling `QuickInput.show`.

There are several reasons why this UI might have to be hidden and the extension will be notified through `QuickInput.onDidHide`. (Examples include: an explicit call to `QuickInput.hide`, the user pressing Esc, some other input UI opening, etc.)

A user pressing Enter or some other gesture implying acceptance of the current state does not automatically hide this UI component. It is up to the extension to decide whether to accept the user's input and if the UI should indeed be hidden through a call to `QuickInput.hide`.

When the extension no longer needs this input UI, it should `QuickInput.dispose` it to allow for freeing up any resources associated with it.

See `QuickPick` and `InputBox` for concrete UIs.

#### Events

*   **`onDidHide`**: `Event<void>`
    An event signaling when this input UI is hidden.
    There are several reasons why this UI might have to be hidden and the extension will be notified through `QuickInput.onDidHide`. (Examples include: an explicit call to `QuickInput.hide`, the user pressing Esc, some other input UI opening, etc.)

#### Properties

*   **`busy`**: `boolean`
    If the UI should show a progress indicator. Defaults to `false`.
    Change this to `true`, e.g., while loading more data or validating user input.
*   **`enabled`**: `boolean`
    If the UI should allow for user input. Defaults to `true`.
    Change this to `false`, e.g., while validating user input or loading data for the next step in user input.
*   **`ignoreFocusOut`**: `boolean`
    If the UI should stay open even when loosing UI focus. Defaults to `false`. This setting is ignored on iPad and is always `false`.
*   **`step`**: `number`
    An optional current step count.
*   **`title`**: `string`
    An optional title.
*   **`totalSteps`**: `number`
    An optional total step count.

#### Methods

*   **`dispose(): void`**
    Dispose of this input UI and any associated resources. If it is still visible, it is first hidden. After this call the input UI is no longer functional and no additional methods or properties on it should be accessed. Instead a new input UI should be created.

    | Parameter   | Description     |
    | :---------- | :-------------- |
    | **Returns** | **Description** |
    | `void`      |                 |

*   **`hide(): void`**
    Hides this input UI. This will also fire an `QuickInput.onDidHide` event.

    | Parameter   | Description     |
    | :---------- | :-------------- |
    | **Returns** | **Description** |
    | `void`      |                 |

*   **`show(): void`**
    Makes the input UI visible in its current configuration. Any other input UI will first fire an `QuickInput.onDidHide` event.

    | Parameter   | Description     |
    | :---------- | :-------------- |
    | **Returns** | **Description** |
    | `void`      |                 |

### QuickInputButton

Button for an action in a `QuickPick` or `InputBox`.

#### Properties

*   **`iconPath`**: `IconPath`
    Icon for the button.
*   **`tooltip?`**: `string`
    An optional tooltip.

### QuickInputButtons

Predefined buttons for `QuickPick` and `InputBox`.

#### Static

*   **`Back`**: `QuickInputButton`
    A back button for `QuickPick` and `InputBox`.
    When a navigation 'back' button is needed this one should be used for consistency. It comes with a predefined icon, tooltip and location.

### QuickPick<T>

A concrete `QuickInput` to let the user pick an item from a list of items of type `T`. The items can be filtered through a filter text field and there is an option `canSelectMany` to allow for selecting multiple items.

Note that in many cases the more convenient `window.showQuickPick` is easier to use. `window.createQuickPick` should be used when `window.showQuickPick` does not offer the required flexibility.

*   **`onDidChangeValue`**: `Event<string>`
    An event signaling when the value of the filter text has changed.
*   **`onDidHide`**: `Event<void>`
    An event signaling when this input UI is hidden.
    There are several reasons why this UI might have to be hidden and the extension will be notified through `QuickInput.onDidHide`. (Examples include: an explicit call to `QuickInput.hide`, the user pressing Esc, some other input UI opening, etc.)
*   **`onDidTriggerButton`**: `Event<QuickInputButton>`
    An event signaling when a top level button (buttons stored in `buttons`) was triggered. This event does not fire for buttons on a `QuickPickItem`.
*   **`onDidTriggerItemButton`**: `Event<QuickPickItemButtonEvent<T>>`
    An event signaling when a button in a particular `QuickPickItem` was triggered. This event does not fire for buttons in the title bar.

#### Properties

*   **`activeItems`**: `readonly T[]`
    Active items. This can be read and updated by the extension.
*   **`busy`**: `boolean`
    If the UI should show a progress indicator. Defaults to `false`.
    Change this to `true`, e.g., while loading more data or validating user input.
*   **`buttons`**: `readonly QuickInputButton[]`
    Buttons for actions in the UI.
*   **`canSelectMany`**: `boolean`
    If multiple items can be selected at the same time. Defaults to `false`.

### QuickPickItem

Represents an item that can be selected from a list of items.

#### Properties

*   **`alwaysShow?`**: `boolean`
    Always show this item.
    Note: this property is ignored when `kind` is set to `QuickPickItemKind.Separator`
*   **`buttons?`**: `readonly QuickInputButton[]`
    Optional buttons that will be rendered on this particular item. These buttons will trigger an `QuickPickItemButtonEvent` when clicked. Buttons are only rendered when using a quickpick created by the `createQuickPick()` API. Buttons are not rendered when using the `showQuickPick()` API.
    Note: this property is ignored when `kind` is set to `QuickPickItemKind.Separator`
*   **`description?`**: `string`
    A human-readable string which is rendered less prominent in the same line. Supports rendering of theme icons via the `$(<name>)`-syntax.
    Note: this property is ignored when `kind` is set to `QuickPickItemKind.Separator`
*   **`detail?`**: `string`
    A human-readable string which is rendered less prominent in a separate line. Supports rendering of theme icons via the `$(<name>)`-syntax.
    Note: this property is ignored when `kind` is set to `QuickPickItemKind.Separator`
*   **`iconPath?`**: `IconPath`
    The icon path or `ThemeIcon` for the `QuickPickItem`.
*   **`kind?`**: `QuickPickItemKind`
    The kind of `QuickPickItem` that will determine how this item is rendered in the quick pick. When not specified, the default is `QuickPickItemKind.Default`.
*   **`label`**: `string`
    A human-readable string which is rendered prominent. Supports rendering of theme icons via the `$(<name>)`-syntax.
    Note: When `kind` is set to `QuickPickItemKind.Default` (so a regular item instead of a separator), it supports rendering of theme icons via the `$(<name>)`-syntax.
*   **`picked?`**: `boolean`
    Optional flag indicating if this item is picked initially.
    This is only honored when using the `showQuickPick()` API. To do the same thing with the `createQuickPick()` API, simply set the `QuickPick.selectedItems` to the items you want picked initially. (Note: This is only honored when the picker allows multiple selections.)
    See also `QuickPickOptions.canPickMany`
    Note: this property is ignored when `kind` is set to `QuickPickItemKind.Separator`

### QuickPickItemButtonEvent<T>

    The item that the button belongs to.

### QuickPickItemKind

The kind of quick pick item.

#### Enumeration Members

*   **`Separator`**: `-1`
    When a `QuickPickItem` has a kind of `Separator`, the item is just a visual separator and does not represent a real item. The only property that applies is `label` . All other properties on `QuickPickItem` will be ignored and have no effect.
*   **`Default`**: `0`
    The default `QuickPickItem.kind` is an item that can be selected in the quick pick.

### QuickPickOptions

Options to configure the behavior of the quick pick UI.

#### Properties

*   **`canPickMany?`**: `boolean`
    An optional flag to make the picker accept multiple selections, if `true` the result is an array of picks.
*   **`ignoreFocusOut?`**: `boolean`
    Set to `true` to keep the picker open when focus moves to another part of the editor or to another window. This setting is ignored on iPad and is always `false`.
*   **`matchOnDescription?`**: `boolean`
    An optional flag to include the description when filtering the picks.
*   **`matchOnDetail?`**: `boolean`
    An optional flag to include the detail when filtering the picks.

    An optional string that represents the title of the quick pick.

### Range

A range represents an ordered pair of two positions. It is guaranteed that `start.isBeforeOrEqual(end)`

Range objects are immutable. Use the `with`, `intersection`, or `union` methods to derive new ranges from an existing range.

#### Constructors

*   **`new Range(start: Position, end: Position): Range`**
    Create a new range from two positions. If `start` is not before or equal to `end`, the values will be swapped.

### RelativePattern

A relative pattern is a helper to construct glob patterns that are matched relatively to a base file path. The base path can either be an absolute file path as `string` or `uri` or a `WorkspaceFolder`, which is the preferred way of creating the relative pattern.

#### Constructors

*   **`new RelativePattern(base: string | Uri | WorkspaceFolder, pattern: string): RelativePattern`**
    Creates a new relative pattern object with a base file path and pattern to match. This pattern will be matched on file paths relative to the base.
    Example:
    ```javascript
    const folder = vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders?.[0];
    if (folder) {
        // Match any TypeScript file in the root of this workspace folder
        const pattern1 = new vscode.RelativePattern(folder, '*.ts');
        // Match any TypeScript file in `someFolder` inside this workspace folder
        const pattern2 = new vscode.RelativePattern(folder, 'someFolder/*.ts');
    }
    ```

    | Parameter                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
    | :---------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | `base`: `string` \| `Uri` \| `WorkspaceFolder` | A base to which this pattern will be matched against relatively. It is recommended to pass in a workspace folder if the pattern should match inside the workspace. Otherwise, a `uri` or `string` should only be used if the pattern is for a file path outside the workspace. |
    | `pattern`: `string`                       | A file glob pattern like `*.{ts,js}` that will be matched on paths relative to the base.                                                                                                                                                                             |
    | **Returns**                               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
    | `RelativePattern`                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

#### Properties

*   **`base`**: `string`
    A base file path to which this pattern will be matched against relatively.
    This matches the `fsPath` value of `RelativePattern.baseUri`.
    Note: updating this value will update `RelativePattern.baseUri` to be a uri with `file` scheme.
    *   @deprecated - This property is deprecated, please use `RelativePattern.baseUri` instead.
*   **`baseUri`**: `Uri`
    A base file path to which this pattern will be matched against relatively. The file path must be absolute, should not have any trailing path separators and not include any relative segments (`.` or `..`).
*   **`pattern`**: `string`
    A file glob pattern like `*.{ts,js}` that will be matched on file paths relative to the base path.
    Example: Given a base of `/home/work/folder` and a file path of `/home/work/folder/index.js`, the file glob pattern will match on `index.js`.

### RenameProvider

The rename provider interface defines the contract between extensions and the rename-feature.

#### Methods

*   **`prepareRename(document: TextDocument, position: Position, token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<Range | {placeholder: string, range: Range}>`**
    Optional function for resolving and validating a position before running rename. The result can be a range or a range and a placeholder text. The placeholder text should be the identifier of the symbol which is being renamed - when omitted the text in the returned range is used.
    Note: This function should throw an error or return a rejected thenable when the provided location doesn't allow for a rename.

The telemetry sender is the contract between a telemetry logger and some telemetry service. Note that extensions must NOT call the methods of their sender directly as the logger provides extra guards and cleaning.
```javascript
const sender: vscode.TelemetrySender = {...};
const logger = vscode.env.createTelemetryLogger(sender);

// GOOD - uses the logger
logger.logUsage('myEvent', { myData: 'myValue' });

// BAD - uses the sender directly: no data cleansing, ignores user settings, no echoing to the telemetry output channel etc
sender.logEvent('myEvent', { myData: 'myValue' });

*   **`shellPath?`**: `string`
    A path to a custom shell executable to be used in the terminal.
*   **`strictEnv?`**: `boolean`
    Whether the terminal process environment should be exactly as provided in `TerminalOptions.env`. When this is `false` (default), the environment will be based on the window's environment and also apply configured platform settings like `terminal.integrated.env.windows` on top. When this is `true`, the complete environment must be provided as nothing will be inherited from the process or any configuration.

### TerminalProfile

### TerminalShellExecution

A command that was executed in a terminal.

#### Properties

*   **`commandLine`**: `TerminalShellExecutionCommandLine`
    The command line that was executed. The confidence of this value depends on the specific shell's shell integration implementation. This value may become more accurate after `window.onDidEndTerminalShellExecution` is fired.
    Example
    ```javascript
    // Log the details of the command line on start and end
    window.onDidStartTerminalShellExecution(event => {
        const commandLine = event.execution.commandLine;
        console.log(`Command started\n${summarizeCommandLine(commandLine)}`);
    });
    window.onDidEndTerminalShellExecution(event => {
        const commandLine = event.execution.commandLine;
        console.log(`Command ended\n${summarizeCommandLine(commandLine)}`);
    });
    function summarizeCommandLine(commandLine: TerminalShellExecutionCommandLine) {
        return [
            ` Command line: ${command.commandLine.value}`,
            ` Confidence: ${command.commandLine.confidence}`,
            ` Trusted: ${command.commandLine.isTrusted}`
        ].join('\n');
    }
    ```
*   **`cwd`**: `Uri`
    The working directory that was reported by the shell when this command executed. This `Uri` may represent a file on another machine (eg. ssh into another machine). This requires the shell integration to support working directory reporting.

#### Methods

*   **`read(): AsyncIterable<string>`**
    Creates a stream of raw data (including escape sequences) that is written to the terminal. This will only include data that was written after `read` was called for the first time, ie. you must call `read` immediately after the command is executed via `TerminalShellIntegration.executeCommand` or `window.onDidStartTerminalShellExecution` to not miss any data.
    Example
    ```javascript
    // Log all data written to the terminal for a command
    const command = term.shellIntegration.executeCommand({ commandLine: 'echo "Hello world"' });
    const stream = command.read();
    for await (const data of stream) {
        console.log(data);
    }
    ```

    | Parameter                 | Description     |
    | :------------------------ | :-------------- |
    | **Returns**               | **Description** |
    | `AsyncIterable<string>`   |                 |

### TerminalShellExecutionCommandLine

A command line that was executed in a terminal.

#### Properties

*   **`confidence`**: `TerminalShellExecutionCommandLineConfidence`
    The confidence of the command line value which is determined by how the value was obtained. This depends upon the implementation of the shell integration script.
*   **`isTrusted`**: `boolean`
    Whether the command line value came from a trusted source and is therefore safe to execute without user additional confirmation, such as a notification that asks "Do you want to execute (command)?". This verification is likely only needed if you are going to execute the command again.
    This is `true` only when the command line was reported explicitly by the shell integration script (ie. high confidence) and it used a nonce for verification.
*   **`value`**: `string`
    The full command line that was executed, including both the command and its arguments.

### TerminalShellExecutionCommandLineConfidence

The confidence of a `TerminalShellExecutionCommandLine` value.

#### Enumeration Members

*   **`Low`**: `0`
    The command line value confidence is low. This means that the value was read from the terminal buffer using markers reported by the shell integration script. Additionally one of the following conditions will be met:
    *   The command started on the very left-most column which is unusual, or
    *   The command is multi-line which is more difficult to accurately detect due to line continuation characters and right prompts.
    *   Command line markers were not reported by the shell integration script.
*   **`Medium`**: `1`
    The command line value confidence is medium. This means that the value was read from the terminal buffer using markers reported by the shell integration script. The command is single-line and does not start on the very left-most column (which is unusual).
*   **`High`**: `2`
    The command line value confidence is high. This means that the value was explicitly sent from the shell integration script or the command was executed via the `TerminalShellIntegration.executeCommand` API.

### TerminalShellExecutionEndEvent

An event signalling that an execution has ended in a terminal.

#### Properties

*   **`execution`**: `TerminalShellExecution`
    The terminal shell execution that has ended.
*   **`exitCode`**: `number`
    The exit code reported by the shell.
    When this is `undefined` it can mean several things:
    *   The shell either did not report an exit code (ie. the shell integration script is misbehaving)
    *   The shell reported a command started before the command finished (eg. a sub-shell was opened).
    *   The user canceled the command via ctrl+c.
    *   The user pressed enter when there was no input.
    Generally this should not happen. Depending on the use case, it may be best to treat this as a failure.
    Example
    ```javascript
    const execution = shellIntegration.executeCommand({ command: 'echo', args: ['Hello world'] });
    window.onDidEndTerminalShellExecution(event => {
        if (event.execution === execution) {
            if (event.exitCode === undefined) {
                console.log('Command finished but exit code is unknown');
            } else if (event.exitCode === 0) {
                console.log('Command succeeded');
            } else {
                console.log('Command failed');
            }
        }
    });
    ```
*   **`shellIntegration`**: `TerminalShellIntegration`
    The shell integration object.
*   **`terminal`**: `Terminal`
    The terminal that shell integration has been activated in.

### TerminalShellExecutionStartEvent

An event signalling that an execution has started in a terminal.

#### Properties

*   **`execution`**: `TerminalShellExecution`
    The terminal shell execution that has ended.
*   **`shellIntegration`**: `TerminalShellIntegration`
    The shell integration object.
*   **`terminal`**: `Terminal`
    The terminal that shell integration has been activated in.

### TerminalShellIntegration

Shell integration-powered capabilities owned by a terminal.

#### Properties

*   **`cwd`**: `Uri`
    The current working directory of the terminal. This `Uri` may represent a file on another machine (eg. ssh into another machine). This requires the shell integration to support working directory reporting.

#### Methods

*   **`executeCommand(commandLine: string): TerminalShellExecution`**
    Execute a command, sending `^C` as necessary to interrupt any running command if needed.
    Example
    ```javascript
    // Execute a command in a terminal immediately after being created
    const myTerm = window.createTerminal();
    window.onDidChangeTerminalShellIntegration(async ({ terminal, shellIntegration }) => {
        if (terminal === myTerm) {
            const execution = shellIntegration.executeCommand('echo "Hello world"');
            window.onDidEndTerminalShellExecution(event => {
                if (event.execution === execution) {
                    console.log(`Command exited with code ${event.exitCode}`);
                }
            });
        }
    });
    // Fallback to sendText if there is no shell integration within 3 seconds of launching
    setTimeout(() => {
        if (!myTerm.shellIntegration) {
            myTerm.sendText('echo "Hello world"');
            // Without shell integration, we can't know when the command has finished or what the
            // exit code was.
        }
    }, 3000);
    ```
    Example
    ```javascript
    // Send command to terminal that has been alive for a while
    const commandLine = 'echo "Hello world"';
    if (term.shellIntegration) {
        const execution = shellIntegration.executeCommand({ commandLine });
        window.onDidEndTerminalShellExecution(event => {
            if (event.execution === execution) {
                console.log(`Command exited with code ${event.exitCode}`);
            }
        });
    } else {
        term.sendText(commandLine);
        // Without shell integration, we can't know when the command has finished or what the
        // exit code was.
    }
    ```

*   **`executeCommand(executable: string, args: string[]): TerminalShellExecution`**
    Execute a command, sending `^C` as necessary to interrupt any running command if needed.
    Note This is not guaranteed to work as shell integration must be activated. Check whether `TerminalShellExecution.exitCode` is rejected to verify whether it was successful.
    Example
    ```javascript
    // Execute a command in a terminal immediately after being created

### TerminalShellIntegrationChangeEvent

An event signalling that a terminal's shell integration has changed.

#### Properties

*   **`shellIntegration`**: `TerminalShellIntegration`
    The shell integration object.
*   **`terminal`**: `Terminal`
    The terminal that shell integration has been activated in.

### TerminalSplitLocationOptions

Uses the parent `Terminal`'s location for the terminal

#### Properties

*   **`parentTerminal`**: `Terminal`
    The parent terminal to split this terminal beside. This works whether the parent terminal is in the panel or the editor area.

### TerminalState

Represents the state of a `Terminal`.

#### Properties

*   **`isInteractedWith`**: `boolean`
    Whether the `Terminal` has been interacted with. Interaction means that the terminal has sent data to the process which depending on the terminal's mode. By default input is sent when a key is pressed or when a command or extension sends text, but based on the terminal's mode it can also happen on:
    *   a pointer click event
    *   a pointer scroll event
    *   a pointer move event
    *   terminal focus in/out
    For more information on events that can send data see "DEC Private Mode Set (DECSET)" on https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html
*   **`shell`**: `string`
    The detected shell type of the `Terminal`. This will be `undefined` when there is not a clear signal as to what the shell is, or the shell is not supported yet. This value should change to the shell type of a sub-shell when launched (for example, running bash inside zsh).
    Note that the possible values are currently defined as any of the following: 'bash', 'cmd', 'csh', 'fish', 'gitbash', 'julia', 'ksh', 'node', 'nu', 'pwsh', 'python', 'sh', 'wsl', 'zsh'.

### TestController

Entry point to discover and execute tests. It contains `TestController.items` which are used to populate the editor UI, and is associated with run profiles to allow for tests to be executed.

#### Properties

*   **`id`**: `string`
    The id of the controller passed in `tests.createTestController`. This must be globally unique.
*   **`items`**: `TestItemCollection`
    A collection of "top-level" `TestItem` instances, which can in turn have their own children to form the "test tree."
    The extension controls when to add tests. For example, extensions should add tests for a file when `workspace.onDidOpenTextDocument` fires in order for decorations for tests within a file to be visible.
    However, the editor may sometimes explicitly request children using the `resolveHandler` See the documentation on that method for more details.
*   **`label`**: `string`
    Human-readable label for the test controller.
*   **`refreshHandler`**: (`token`: `CancellationToken`) => `void` | `Thenable<void>`
    If this method is present, a refresh button will be present in the UI, and this method will be invoked when it's clicked. When called, the extension should scan the workspace for any new, changed, or removed tests.
    It's recommended that extensions try to update tests in realtime, using a `FileSystemWatcher` for example, and use this method as a fallback.

    | Parameter                 | Description                                                   |
    | :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------ |

    | **Returns**               | **Description**                                               |
    | `void` \| `Thenable<void>`  | A thenable that resolves when tests have been refreshed.    |
*   **`resolveHandler?`**: (`item`: `TestItem`) => `void` | `Thenable<void>`
    A function provided by the extension that the editor may call to request children of a test item, if the `TestItem.canResolveChildren` is `true`. When called, the item should discover children and call `TestController.createTestItem` as children are discovered.
    Generally the extension manages the lifecycle of test items, but under certain conditions the editor may request the children of a specific item to be loaded. For example, if the user requests to re-run tests after reloading the editor, the editor may need to call this method to resolve the previously-run tests.
    The item in the explorer will automatically be marked as "busy" until the function returns or the returned thenable resolves.

    | Parameter                 | Description                                                                                               |
    | :------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `item`: `TestItem`        | An unresolved test item for which children are being requested, or `undefined` to resolve the controller's initial items. |
    | **Returns**               | **Description**                                                                                           |
    | `void` \| `Thenable<void>`  |                                                                                                           |

*   **`createTestRun(request: TestRunRequest, name?: string, persist?: boolean): TestRun`**
    Creates a `TestRun`. This should be called by the `TestRunProfile` when a request is made to execute tests, and may also be called if a test run is detected externally. Once created, tests that are included in the request will be moved into the queued state.
    All runs created using the same request instance will be grouped together. This is useful if, for example, a single suite of tests is run on multiple platforms.

    | Parameter                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
    | :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `request`: `TestRunRequest` | Test run request. Only tests inside the `include` may be modified, and tests in its `exclude` are ignored.                                                                                                                          |
    | `name?`: `string`         | The human-readable name of the run. This can be used to disambiguate multiple sets of results in a test run. It is useful if tests are run across multiple platforms, for example.                                                 |
    | `persist?`: `boolean`     | Whether the results created by the run should be persisted in the editor. This may be `false` if the results are coming from a file already saved externally, such as a coverage information file.                                  |

    | `TestRun`                 | An instance of the `TestRun`. It will be considered "running" from the moment this method is invoked until `TestRun.end` is called.                                                                                                 |

*   **`dispose(): void`**
    Unregisters the test controller, disposing of its associated tests and unpersisted results.

    | Parameter   | Description     |
    | :---------- | :-------------- |
    | **Returns** | **Description** |
    | `void`      |                 |

*   **`invalidateTestResults(items?: TestItem | readonly TestItem[]): void`**
    Marks an item's results as being outdated. This is commonly called when code or configuration changes and previous results should no longer be considered relevant. The same logic used to mark results as outdated may be used to drive continuous test runs.
    If an item is passed to this method, test results for the item and all of its children will be marked as outdated. If no item is passed, then all test owned by the `TestController` will be marked as outdated.
    Any test runs started before the moment this method is called, including runs which may still be ongoing, will be marked as outdated and deprioritized in the editor's UI.

    | Parameter                                     | Description                                                                                               |
    | :-------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `items?`: `TestItem` \| `readonly TestItem[]` | Item to mark as outdated. If `undefined`, all the controller's items are marked outdated.                 |
    | **Returns**                                   | **Description**                                                                                           |

### TestCoverageCount

A class that contains information about a covered resource. A count can be give for lines, branches, and declarations in a file.

#### Constructors

*   **`new TestCoverageCount(covered: number, total: number): TestCoverageCount`**

    | Parameter             | Description                               |
    | :-------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
    | `covered`: `number`   | Value for `TestCoverageCount.covered`     |
    | `total`: `number`     | Value for `TestCoverageCount.total`       |
    | **Returns**           | **Description**                           |
    | `TestCoverageCount`   |                                           |

#### Properties

*   **`covered`**: `number`
    Number of items covered in the file.
*   **`total`**: `number`
    Total number of covered items in the file.

### TestItem

An item shown in the "test explorer" view.

A `TestItem` can represent either a test suite or a test itself, since they both have similar capabilities.

#### Properties

*   **`busy`**: `boolean`
    Controls whether the item is shown as "busy" in the Test Explorer view. This is useful for showing status while discovering children.
    Defaults to `false`.
*   **`canResolveChildren`**: `boolean`
    Indicates whether this test item may have children discovered by resolving.
    If `true`, this item is shown as expandable in the Test Explorer view and expanding the item will cause `TestController.resolveHandler` to be invoked with the item.
    Default to `false`.
*   **`children`**: `TestItemCollection`
    The children of this test item. For a test suite, this may contain the individual test cases or nested suites.
*   **`description?`**: `string`
    Optional description that appears next to the label.
*   **`error`**: `string` | `MarkdownString`
    Optional error encountered while loading the test.
    Note that this is not a test result and should only be used to represent errors in test discovery, such as syntax errors.
*   **`id`**: `string`
    Identifier for the `TestItem`. This is used to correlate test results and tests in the document with those in the workspace (test explorer). This cannot change for the lifetime of the `TestItem`, and must be unique among its parent's direct children.
*   **`label`**: `string`
    Display name describing the test case.
*   **`parent`**: `TestItem`
    The parent of this item. It's set automatically, and is `undefined` top-level items in the `TestController.items` and for items that aren't yet included in another item's `children`.
*   **`range`**: `Range`
    Location of the test item in its `uri`.
    This is only meaningful if the `uri` points to a file.
*   **`sortText?`**: `string`
    A string that should be used when comparing this item with other items. When falsy the `label` is used.
*   **`tags`**: `readonly TestTag[]`
    Tags associated with this test item. May be used in combination with tags, or simply as an organizational feature.
*   **`uri`**: `Uri`
    URI this `TestItem` is associated with. May be a file or directory.

### TestRun

A `TestRun` represents an in-progress or completed test run and provides methods to report the state of individual tests in the run.

#### Events

*   **`onDidDispose`**: `Event<void>`
    An event fired when the editor is no longer interested in data associated with the test run.

#### Properties

*   **`isPersisted`**: `boolean`
    Whether the test run will be persisted across reloads by the editor.
*   **`name`**: `string`

    A cancellation token which will be triggered when the test run is canceled from the UI.

#### Methods

*   **`addCoverage(fileCoverage: FileCoverage): void`**

### TestRunProfile

A `TestRunProfile` describes one way to execute tests in a `TestController`.

#### Events

*   **`onDidChangeDefault`**: `Event<boolean>`
    Fired when a user has changed whether this is a default profile. The event contains the new value of `isDefault`

#### Properties

*   **`configureHandler`**: () => `void`
    If this method is present, a configuration gear will be present in the UI, and this method will be invoked when it's clicked. When called, you can take other editor actions, such as showing a quick pick or opening a configuration file.

    | Parameter   | Description     |
    | :---------- | :-------------- |
    | **Returns** | **Description** |
    | `void`      |                 |

*   **`isDefault`**: `boolean`
    Controls whether this profile is the default action that will be taken when its `kind` is actioned. For example, if the user clicks the generic "run all" button, then the default profile for `TestRunProfileKind.Run` will be executed, although the user can configure this.
    Changes the user makes in their default profiles will be reflected in this property after a `onDidChangeDefault` event.
*   **`kind`**: `TestRunProfileKind`
    Configures what kind of execution this profile controls. If there are no profiles for a kind, it will not be available in the UI.
*   **`label`**: `string`
    Label shown to the user in the UI.
    Note that the label has some significance if the user requests that tests be re-run in a certain way. For example, if tests were run normally and the user requests to re-run them in debug mode, the editor will attempt use a configuration with the same label of the `Debug` kind. If there is no such configuration, the default will be used.
*   **`loadDetailedCoverage?`**: (`testRun`: `TestRun`, `fileCoverage`: `FileCoverage`, `token`: `CancellationToken`) => `Thenable<FileCoverageDetail[]>`
    An extension-provided function that provides detailed statement and function-level coverage for a file. The editor will call this when more detail is needed for a file, such as when it's opened in an editor or expanded in the Test Coverage view.
    The `FileCoverage` object passed to this function is the same instance emitted on `TestRun.addCoverage` calls associated with this profile.

    | Parameter                         | Description     |
    | :-------------------------------- | :-------------- |
    | `testRun`: `TestRun`              |                 |
    | `fileCoverage`: `FileCoverage`    |                 |
    | `token`: `CancellationToken`      |                 |
    | **Returns**                       | **Description** |
    | `Thenable<FileCoverageDetail[]>`  |                 |

*   **`loadDetailedCoverageForTest?`**: (`testRun`: `TestRun`, `fileCoverage`: `FileCoverage`, `fromTestItem`: `TestItem`, `token`: `CancellationToken`) => `Thenable<FileCoverageDetail[]>`
    An extension-provided function that provides detailed statement and function-level coverage for a single test in a file. This is the per-test sibling of `TestRunProfile.loadDetailedCoverage`, called only if a test item is provided in `FileCoverage.includesTests` and only for files where such data is reported.
    Often `TestRunProfile.loadDetailedCoverage` will be called first when a user opens a file, and then this method will be called if they drill down into specific per-test coverage information. This method should then return coverage data only for statements and declarations executed by the specific test during the run.
    The `FileCoverage` object passed to this function is the same instance emitted on `TestRun.addCoverage` calls associated with this profile.

    | Parameter                         | Description                                                                 |
    | :-------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `testRun`: `TestRun`              | The test run that generated the coverage data.                              |
    | `fileCoverage`: `FileCoverage`    | The file coverage object to load detailed coverage for.                     |
    | `fromTestItem`: `TestItem`        | The test item to request coverage information for.                          |
    | `token`: `CancellationToken`      | A cancellation token that indicates the operation should be cancelled.      |
    | **Returns**                       | **Description**                                                             |
    | `Thenable<FileCoverageDetail[]>`  |                                                                             |

*   **`runHandler`**: (`request`: `TestRunRequest`, `token`: `CancellationToken`) => `void` | `Thenable<void>`
    Handler called to start a test run. When invoked, the function should call `TestController.createTestRun` at least once, and all test runs associated with the request should be created before the function returns or the returned promise is resolved.
    If `supportsContinuousRun` is set, then `TestRunRequest.continuous` may be `true`. In this case, the profile should observe changes to source code and create new test runs by calling `TestController.createTestRun`, until the cancellation is requested on the `token`.

    | Parameter                                                                   | Description                             |

### TestRunProfileKind

The kind of executions that `TestRunProfile`s control.

#### Enumeration Members

*   **`Run`**: `1`
    The Run test profile kind.
*   **`Debug`**: `2`
    The Debug test profile kind.
*   **`Coverage`**: `3`
    The Coverage test profile kind.

### TestRunRequest

A `TestRunRequest` is a precursor to a `TestRun`, which in turn is created by passing a request to `TestController.createTestRun`. The `TestRunRequest` contains information about which tests should be run, which should not be run, and how they are run (via the profile).

In general, `TestRunRequest`s are created by the editor and pass to `TestRunProfile.runHandler`, however you can also create test requests and runs outside of the `runHandler`.

#### Constructors

*   **`new TestRunRequest(include?: readonly TestItem[], exclude?: readonly TestItem[], profile?: TestRunProfile, continuous?: boolean, preserveFocus?: boolean): TestRunRequest`**

    | Parameter                       | Description                                                         |
    | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | `include?`: `readonly TestItem[]` | Array of specific tests to run, or `undefined` to run all tests     |
    | `exclude?`: `readonly TestItem[]` | An array of tests to exclude from the run.                          |
    | `profile?`: `TestRunProfile`    | The run profile used for this request.                              |
    | `continuous?`: `boolean`        | Whether to run tests continuously as source changes.                |
    | `preserveFocus?`: `boolean`     | Whether to preserve the user's focus when the run is started        |
    | **Returns**                     | **Description**                                                     |
    | `TestRunRequest`                |                                                                     |

#### Properties

*   **`continuous?`**: `boolean`
    Whether the profile should run continuously as source code changes. Only relevant for profiles that set `TestRunProfile.supportsContinuousRun`.
*   **`exclude`**: `readonly TestItem[]`
    An array of tests the user has marked as excluded from the test included in this run; exclusions should apply after inclusions.
    May be omitted if no exclusions were requested. Test controllers should not run excluded tests or any children of excluded tests.
*   **`include`**: `readonly TestItem[]`
    A filter for specific tests to run. If given, the extension should run all of the included tests and all their children, excluding any tests that appear in `TestRunRequest.exclude`. If this property is `undefined`, then the extension should simply run all tests.
    The process of running tests should resolve the children of any test items who have not yet been resolved.
*   **`preserveFocus`**: `boolean`
    Controls how test Test Results view is focused. If `true`, the editor will keep the maintain the user's focus. If `false`, the editor will prefer to move focus into the Test Results view, although this may be configured by users.
*   **`profile`**: `TestRunProfile`
    The profile used for this request. This will always be defined for requests issued from the editor UI, though extensions may programmatically create requests not associated with any profile.

### TestTag

Tags can be associated with `TestItem`s and `TestRunProfile`s. A profile with a tag can only execute tests that include that tag in their `TestItem.tags` array.

#### Constructors

*   **`new TestTag(id: string): TestTag`**
    Creates a new `TestTag` instance.

    | Parameter     | Description                                                           |

#### Properties

*   **`id`**: `string`
    ID of the test tag. `TestTag` instances with the same ID are considered to be identical.

### TextDocument

Represents a text document, such as a source file. Text documents have lines and knowledge about an underlying resource like a file.

#### Properties

*   **`encoding`**: `string`
    The file encoding of this document that will be used when the document is saved.
    Use the `onDidChangeTextDocument`-event to get notified when the document encoding changes.
    Note that the possible encoding values are currently defined as any of the following: 'utf8', 'utf8bom', 'utf16le', 'utf16be', 'windows1252', 'iso88591', 'iso88593', 'iso885915', 'macroman', 'cp437', 'windows1256', 'iso88596', 'windows1257', 'iso88594', 'iso885914', 'windows1250', 'iso88592', 'cp852', 'windows1251', 'cp866', 'cp1125', 'iso88595', 'koi8r', 'koi8u', 'iso885913', 'windows1253', 'iso88597', 'windows1255', 'iso88598', 'iso885910', 'iso885916', 'windows1254', 'iso88599', 'windows1258', 'gbk', 'gb18030', 'cp950', 'big5hkscs', 'shiftjis', 'eucjp', 'euckr', 'windows874', 'iso885911', 'koi8ru', 'koi8t', 'gb2312', 'cp865', 'cp850'.
*   **`eol`**: `EndOfLine`
    The end of line sequence that is predominately used in this document.
*   **`fileName`**: `string`
    The file system path of the associated resource. Shorthand notation for `TextDocument.uri.fsPath`. Independent of the uri scheme.
*   **`isClosed`**: `boolean`
    `true` if the document has been closed. A closed document isn't synchronized anymore and won't be re-used when the same resource is opened again.
*   **`isDirty`**: `boolean`
    `true` if there are unpersisted changes.
*   **`isUntitled`**: `boolean`
    Is this document representing an untitled file which has never been saved yet. Note that this does not mean the document will be saved to disk, use `Uri.scheme` to figure out where a document will be saved, e.g. `file`, `ftp` etc.
*   **`languageId`**: `string`
    The identifier of the language associated with this document.
*   **`lineCount`**: `number`
    The number of lines in this document.
*   **`uri`**: `Uri`
    The associated uri for this document.
    Note that most documents use the `file`-scheme, which means they are files on disk. However, not all documents are saved on disk and therefore the scheme must be checked before trying to access the underlying file or siblings on disk.

    *   Note 1: A custom regular expression must not match the empty string and if it does, it will be ignored.
    *   Note 2: A custom regular expression will fail to match multiline strings and in the name of speed regular expressions should not match words with spaces. Use `TextLine.text` for more complex, non-wordy, scenarios.
    The position will be adjusted.

### TextDocumentContentProvider

A text document content provider allows to add readonly documents to the editor, such as source from a dll or generated html from md.

Content providers are registered for a uri-scheme. When a uri with that scheme is to be loaded the content provider is asked.

    An event to signal a resource has changed.

#### Methods

*   **`provideTextDocumentContent(uri: Uri, token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<string>`**
    Provide textual content for a given uri.
    The editor will use the returned string-content to create a readonly document. Resources allocated should be released when the corresponding document has been closed.
    Note: The contents of the created document might not be identical to the provided text due to end-of-line-sequence normalization.

    | Parameter                     | Description                                                                                     |

    Note that the flag is ignored if a user has disabled preview editors in settings.
*   **`selection?`**: `Range`
    An optional selection to apply for the document in the editor.
*   **`viewColumn?`**: `ViewColumn`
    An optional view column in which the editor should be shown. The default is the `active`. Columns that do not exist will be created as needed up to the maximum of `ViewColumn.Nine`. Use `ViewColumn.Beside` to open the editor to the side of the currently active one.

### TextDocumentWillSaveEvent

An event that is fired when a document will be saved.

To make modifications to the document before it is being saved, call the `waitUntil`-function with a thenable that resolves to an array of text edits.

#### Properties

*   **`document`**: `TextDocument`
    The document that will be saved.
*   **`reason`**: `TextDocumentSaveReason`
    The reason why save was triggered.

#### Methods

*   **`waitUntil(thenable: Thenable<readonly TextEdit[]>): void`**
    Allows to pause the event loop and to apply pre-save-edits. Edits of subsequent calls to this function will be applied in order. The edits will be ignored if concurrent modifications of the document happened.
    Note: This function can only be called during event dispatch and not in an asynchronous manner:
    ```javascript
    workspace.onWillSaveTextDocument(event => {
        // async, will *throw* an error
        setTimeout(() => event.waitUntil(promise));
        // sync, OK
        event.waitUntil(promise);
    });

### TreeDragAndDropController<T>

Provides support for drag and drop in `TreeView`.

#### Properties

*   **`dragMimeTypes`**: `readonly string[]`
    The mime types that the `handleDrag` method of this `TreeDragAndDropController` may add to the tree data transfer. This could be well-defined, existing, mime types, and also mime types defined by the extension.
    The recommended mime type of the tree (`application/vnd.code.tree.<treeidlowercase>`) will be automatically added.
*   **`dropMimeTypes`**: `readonly string[]`
    The mime types that the `handleDrop` method of this `DragAndDropController` supports. This could be well-defined, existing, mime types, and also mime types defined by the extension.
    To support drops from trees, you will need to add the mime type of that tree. This includes drops from within the same tree. The mime type of a tree is recommended to be of the format `application/vnd.code.tree.<treeidlowercase>`.
    Use the special `files` mime type to support all types of dropped files `files`, regardless of the file's actual mime type.
    To learn the mime type of a dragged item:
    1.  Set up your `DragAndDropController`
    2.  Use the `Developer: Set Log Level...` command to set the level to "Debug"
    3.  Open the developer tools and drag the item with unknown mime type over your tree. The mime types will be logged to the developer console
    Note that mime types that cannot be sent to the extension will be omitted.

#### Methods

*   **`handleDrag(source: readonly T[], dataTransfer: DataTransfer, token: CancellationToken): void | Thenable<void>`**
    When the user starts dragging items from this `DragAndDropController`, `handleDrag` will be called. Extensions can use `handleDrag` to add their `DataTransferItem` items to the drag and drop.
    Mime types added in `handleDrag` won't be available outside the application.
    When the items are dropped on another tree item in the same tree, your `DataTransferItem` objects will be preserved. Use the recommended mime type for the tree (`application/vnd.code.tree.<treeidlowercase>`) to add tree objects in a data transfer. See the documentation for `DataTransferItem` for how best to take advantage of this.
    To add a data transfer item that can be dragged into the editor, use the application specific mime type `"text/uri-list"`. The data for `"text/uri-list"` should be a string with `toString()`ed Uris separated by `\r\n`. To specify a cursor position in the file, set the Uri's fragment to `L3,5`, where `3` is the line number and `5` is the column number.

    | Parameter                               | Description                                                     |

*   **`handleDrop(target: T, dataTransfer: DataTransfer, token: CancellationToken): void | Thenable<void>`**
    Called when a drag and drop action results in a drop on the tree that this `DragAndDropController` belongs to.
    Extensions should fire `onDidChangeTreeData` for any elements that need to be refreshed.

    | Parameter                               | Description                                                         |

#### Properties

*   **`accessibilityInformation?`**: `AccessibilityInformation`
    Accessibility information used when screen reader interacts with this tree item. Generally, a `TreeItem` has no need to set the `role` of the `accessibilityInformation`; however, there are cases where a `TreeItem` is not displayed in a tree-like way where setting the `role` may make sense.
*   **`checkboxState?`**: `TreeItemCheckboxState` | {`accessibilityInformation`: `AccessibilityInformation`, `state`: `TreeItemCheckboxState`, `tooltip`: `string`}
    `TreeItemCheckboxState` of the tree item. `onDidChangeTreeData` should be fired when `checkboxState` changes.

    `TreeItemCollapsibleState` of the tree item.
*   **`command?`**: `Command`
    The `Command` that should be executed when the tree item is selected.
    Please use `vscode.open` or `vscode.diff` as command IDs when the tree item is opening something in the editor. Using these commands ensures that the resulting editor will appear consistent with how other built-in trees open editors.
*   **`contextValue?`**: `string`
    Context value of the tree item. This can be used to contribute item specific actions in the tree.
    For example, a tree item is given a context value as `folder`. When contributing actions to `view/item/context` using `menus` extension point, you can specify context value for key `viewItem` in `when` expression like `viewItem == folder`.
    ```json
    "contributes": {

    | Parameter                                                                   | Description     |
    | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------- |
    | `element`: `T`                                                              |                 |
    | `options?`: {`expand`: `number` \| `boolean`, `focus`: `boolean`, `select`: `boolean`} |                 |
    | **Returns**                                                                 | **Description** |
    | `Thenable<void>`                                                            |                 |

### TreeViewExpansionEvent<T>

The event that is fired when an element in the `TreeView` is expanded or collapsed

#### Properties

*   **`element`**: `T`
    Element that is expanded or collapsed.

### TreeViewOptions<T>

Options for creating a `TreeView`

#### Properties

*   **`canSelectMany?`**: `boolean`
    Whether the tree supports multi-select. When the tree supports multi-select and a command is executed from the tree, the first argument to the command is the tree item that the command was executed on and the second argument is an array containing all selected tree items.
*   **`dragAndDropController?`**: `TreeDragAndDropController<T>`
    An optional interface to implement drag and drop in the tree view.
*   **`manageCheckboxStateManually?`**: `boolean`
    By default, when the children of a tree item have already been fetched, child checkboxes are automatically managed based on the checked state of the parent tree item. If the tree item is collapsed by default (meaning that the children haven't yet been fetched) then child checkboxes will not be updated. To override this behavior and manage child and parent checkbox state in the extension, set this to `true`.
    Examples where `TreeViewOptions.manageCheckboxStateManually` is `false`, the default behavior:
    1.  A tree item is checked, then its children are fetched. The children will be checked.
    2.  A tree item's parent is checked. The tree item and all of it's siblings will be checked.
        ```
        * Parent
            + Child 1
            + Child 2
        When the user checks Parent, the tree will look like this:
        * Parent (checked)
            + Child 1 (checked)
            + Child 2 (checked)
        ```
    3.  A tree item and all of it's siblings are checked. The parent will be checked.
        ```
        * Parent
            + Child 1
            + Child 2
        When the user checks Child 1 and Child 2, the tree will look like this:
        * Parent (checked)
            + Child 1 (checked)
            + Child 2 (checked)
        ```
    4.  A tree item is unchecked. The parent will be unchecked.
        ```
        * Parent (checked)
            + Child 1 (checked)
            + Child 2 (checked)
        When the user unchecks Child 1, the tree will look like this:
        * Parent
            + Child 1
            + Child 2 (checked)
        ```
*   **`showCollapseAll?`**: `boolean`
    Whether to show collapse all action or not.
*   **`treeDataProvider`**: `TreeDataProvider<T>`

### UIKind

Possible kinds of UI that can use extensions.

#### Enumeration Members

*   **`Desktop`**: `1`
    Extensions are accessed from a desktop application.
*   **`Web`**: `2`
    Extensions are accessed from a web browser.

### Uri

A universal resource identifier representing either a file on disk or another resource, like untitled resources.

#### Static

*   **`file(path: string): Uri`**
    Create an URI from a file system path. The scheme will be `file`.
    The difference between `Uri.parse` and `Uri.file` is that the latter treats the argument as path, not as stringified-uri. E.g. `Uri.file(path)` is not the same as `Uri.parse('file://' + path)` because the path might contain characters that are interpreted (`#` and `?`). See the following sample:
    ```javascript
    const good = URI.file('/coding/c#/project1');
    good.scheme === 'file';
    good.path === '/coding/c#/project1';
    good.fragment === '';

    const bad = URI.parse('file://' + '/coding/c#/project1');
    bad.scheme === 'file';
    bad.path === '/coding/c'; // path is now broken
    bad.fragment === '/project1';
    ```

    | Parameter       | Description                   |
    | :-------------- | :---------------------------- |
    | `path`: `string`  | A file system or UNC path.  |
    | **Returns**     | **Description**               |
    | `Uri`           | A new `Uri` instance.         |

*   **`from(components: {authority: string, fragment: string, path: string, query: string, scheme: string}): Uri`**
    Create an URI from its component parts
    See also `Uri.toString`

    | Parameter                                                                                   | Description                   |
    | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------- |
    | `components`: {`authority`: `string`, `fragment`: `string`, `path`: `string`, `query`: `string`, `scheme`: `string`} | The component parts of an Uri. |
    | **Returns**                                                                                 | **Description**               |
    | `Uri`                                                                                       | A new `Uri` instance.         |

*   **`joinPath(base: Uri, ...pathSegments: string[]): Uri`**
    Create a new uri which path is the result of joining the path of the base uri with the provided path segments.
    *   Note 1: `joinPath` only affects the path component and all other components (scheme, authority, query, and fragment) are left as they are.
    *   Note 2: The base uri must have a path; an error is thrown otherwise.
    The path segments are normalized in the following ways:
    *   sequences of path separators (`/` or `\`) are replaced with a single separator
    *   for `file`-uris on windows, the backslash-character (`\`) is considered a path-separator
    *   the `..`-segment denotes the parent segment, the `.` denotes the current segment
    *   paths have a root which always remains, for instance on windows drive-letters are roots so that is true: `joinPath(Uri.file('file:///c:/root'), '../../other').fsPath === 'c:/other'`

    | Parameter                   | Description                           |
    | :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
    | `base`: `Uri`               | An uri. Must have a path.             |
    | `...pathSegments`: `string[]` | One more more path fragments          |
    | **Returns**                 | **Description**                       |
    | `Uri`                       | A new uri which path is joined with the given fragments |

*   **`parse(value: string, strict?: boolean): Uri`**
    Create an URI from a string, e.g. `http://www.example.com/some/path`, `file:///usr/home`, or `scheme:with/path`.
    Note that for a while uris without a scheme were accepted. That is not correct as all uris should have a scheme. To avoid breakage of existing code the optional `strict`-argument has been added. We strongly advise to use it, e.g. `Uri.parse('my:uri', true)`
    See also `Uri.toString`

    | Parameter           | Description                                                       |
    | :------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `value`: `string`   | The string value of an Uri.                                       |
    | `strict?`: `boolean` | Throw an error when `value` is empty or when no scheme can be parsed. |
    | **Returns**         | **Description**                                                   |
    | `Uri`               | A new `Uri` instance.                                             |

#### Constructors

*   **`new Uri(scheme: string, authority: string, path: string, query: string, fragment: string): Uri`**
    Use the `file` and `parse` factory functions to create new `Uri` objects.

    | Parameter           | Description     |
    | :------------------ | :-------------- |
    | `scheme`: `string`  |                 |
    | `authority`: `string` |                 |
    | `path`: `string`    |                 |
    | `query`: `string`   |                 |
    | `fragment`: `string`|                 |
    | **Returns**         | **Description** |
    | `Uri`               |                 |

#### Properties

*   **`authority`**: `string`
    Authority is the `www.example.com` part of `http://www.example.com/some/path?query#fragment`. The part between the first double slashes and the next slash.
*   **`fragment`**: `string`
    Fragment is the `fragment` part of `http://www.example.com/some/path?query#fragment`.
*   **`fsPath`**: `string`
    The string representing the corresponding file system path of this `Uri`.
    Will handle UNC paths and normalize windows drive letters to lower-case. Also uses the platform specific path separator.
    *   Will not validate the path for invalid characters and semantics.
    *   Will not look at the scheme of this `Uri`.
    *   The resulting string shall not be used for display purposes but for disk operations, like `readFile` et al.
    The difference to the `path`-property is the use of the platform specific path separator and the handling of UNC paths. The sample below outlines the difference:
    ```javascript
    const u = URI.parse('file://server/c$/folder/file.txt');
    u.authority === 'server';
    u.path === '/c$/folder/file.txt';
    u.fsPath === '\\serverc$\\folder\\file.txt'; // on Windows
    ```
*   **`path`**: `string`
    Path is the `/some/path` part of `http://www.example.com/some/path?query#fragment`.
*   **`query`**: `string`
    Query is the `query` part of `http://www.example.com/some/path?query#fragment`.
*   **`scheme`**: `string`
    Scheme is the `http` part of `http://www.example.com/some/path?query#fragment`. The part before the first colon.

#### Methods

*   **`toJSON(): any`**
    Returns a JSON representation of this `Uri`.

    | Parameter   | Description     |
    | :---------- | :-------------- |
    | **Returns** | **Description** |
    | `any`       | An object.      |

*   **`toString(skipEncoding?: boolean): string`**
    Returns a string representation of this `Uri`. The representation and normalization of a URI depends on the scheme.
    *   The resulting string can be safely used with `Uri.parse`.
    *   The resulting string shall not be used for display purposes.
    Note that the implementation will encode aggressive which often leads to unexpected, but not incorrect, results. For instance, colons are encoded to `%3A` which might be unexpected in `file`-uri. Also `&` and `=` will be encoded which might be unexpected for `http`-uris. For stability reasons this cannot be changed anymore. If you suffer from too aggressive encoding you should use the `skipEncoding`-argument: `uri.toString(true)`.

    | Parameter               | Description                                                                                                                 |
    | :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `skipEncoding?`: `boolean` | Do not percentage-encode the result, defaults to `false`. Note that the `#` and `?` characters occurring in the path will always be encoded. |
    | **Returns**             | **Description**                                                                                                             |
    | `string`                | A string representation of this `Uri`.                                                                                      |

*   **`with(change: {authority: string, fragment: string, path: string, query: string, scheme: string}): Uri`**
    Derive a new `Uri` from this `Uri`.
    ```javascript
    let file = Uri.parse('before:some/file/path');
    let other = file.with({ scheme: 'after' });
    assert.ok(other.toString() === 'after:some/file/path');
    ```

    | Parameter                                                                                   | Description                                                                                             |
    | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | `change`: {`authority`: `string`, `fragment`: `string`, `path`: `string`, `query`: `string`, `scheme`: `string`} | An object that describes a change to this `Uri`. To unset components use `null` or the empty string. |
    | **Returns**                                                                                 | **Description**                                                                                         |
    | `Uri`                                                                                       | A new `Uri` that reflects the given change. Will return `this Uri` if the change is not changing anything. |

### UriHandler

A uri handler is responsible for handling system-wide uris.

See also `window.registerUriHandler`.

#### Methods

*   **`handleUri(uri: Uri): ProviderResult<void>`**
    Handle the provided system-wide `Uri`.
    See also `window.registerUriHandler`.

    | Parameter               | Description     |
    | :---------------------- | :-------------- |
    | `uri`: `Uri`            |                 |
    | **Returns**             | **Description** |
    | `ProviderResult<void>`  |                 |

### ViewBadge

A badge presenting a value for a view

#### Properties

*   **`tooltip`**: `string`
    A label to present in tooltip for the badge.
*   **`value`**: `number`
    The value to present in the badge.

### ViewColumn

Denotes a location of an editor in the window. Editors can be arranged in a grid and each column represents one editor location in that grid by counting the editors in order of their appearance.

#### Enumeration Members

*   **`Beside`**: `-2`
    A symbolic editor column representing the column to the side of the active one. This value can be used when opening editors, but the resolved `viewColumn`-value of editors will always be `One`, `Two`, `Three`,... or `undefined` but never `Beside`.
*   **`Active`**: `-1`
    A symbolic editor column representing the currently active column. This value can be used when opening editors, but the resolved `viewColumn`-value of editors will always be `One`, `Two`, `Three`,... or `undefined` but never `Active`.
*   **`One`**: `1`
    The first editor column.
*   **`Two`**: `2`
    The second editor column.
*   **`Three`**: `3`
    The third editor column.
*   **`Four`**: `4`
    The fourth editor column.
*   **`Five`**: `5`
    The fifth editor column.
*   **`Six`**: `6`
    The sixth editor column.
*   **`Seven`**: `7`
    The seventh editor column.
*   **`Eight`**: `8`
    The eighth editor column.
*   **`Nine`**: `9`
    The ninth editor column.

### Webview

Displays html content, similarly to an iframe.

#### Events

*   **`onDidReceiveMessage`**: `Event<any>`
    Fired when the webview content posts a message.
    Webview content can post strings or json serializable objects back to an extension. They cannot post `Blob`, `File`, `ImageData` and other DOM specific objects since the extension that receives the message does not run in a browser environment.

#### Properties

*   **`cspSource`**: `string`
    Content security policy source for webview resources.
    This is the origin that should be used in a content security policy rule:
    ```html
    `img-src https: ${webview.cspSource} ...;`;
    ```
*   **`html`**: `string`
    HTML contents of the webview.
    This should be a complete, valid html document. Changing this property causes the webview to be reloaded.
    Webviews are sandboxed from normal extension process, so all communication with the webview must use message passing. To send a message from the extension to the webview, use `postMessage`. To send message from the webview back to an extension, use the `acquireVsCodeApi` function inside the webview to get a handle to the editor's api and then call `.postMessage()`:
    ```html
    <script>
        const vscode = acquireVsCodeApi(); // acquireVsCodeApi can only be invoked once
        vscode.postMessage({ message: 'hello!' });
    </script>
    ```
    To load a resources from the workspace inside a webview, use the `asWebviewUri` method and ensure the resource's directory is listed in `WebviewOptions.localResourceRoots`.
    Keep in mind that even though webviews are sandboxed, they still allow running scripts and loading arbitrary content, so extensions must follow all standard web security best practices when working with webviews. This includes properly sanitizing all untrusted input (including content from the workspace) and setting a content security policy.
*   **`options`**: `WebviewOptions`
    Content settings for the webview.

#### Methods

*   **`asWebviewUri(localResource: Uri): Uri`**
    Convert a uri for the local file system to one that can be used inside webviews.
    Webviews cannot directly load resources from the workspace or local file system using `file:` uris. The `asWebviewUri` function takes a local `file:` uri and converts it into a uri that can be used inside of a webview to load the same resource:
    ```javascript
    webview.html = `<img src="${webview.asWebviewUri( vscode.Uri.file('/Users/codey/workspace/cat.gif') )}">`;
    ```

    | Parameter             | Description     |
    | :-------------------- | :-------------- |
    | `localResource`: `Uri`  |                 |
    | **Returns**           | **Description** |
    | `Uri`                 |                 |

*   **`postMessage(message: any): Thenable<boolean>`**
    Post a message to the webview content.
    Messages are only delivered if the webview is live (either visible or in the background with `retainContextWhenHidden`).

    | Parameter           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
    | :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `message`: `any`    | Body of the message. This must be a string or other json serializable object.  For older versions of vscode, if an `ArrayBuffer` is included in `message`, it will not be serialized properly and will not be received by the webview. Similarly any `TypedArrays`, such as a `Uint8Array`, will be very inefficiently serialized and will also not be recreated as a typed array inside the webview.  However if your extension targets vscode 1.57+ in the `engines` field of its `package.json`, any `ArrayBuffer` values that appear in `message` will be more efficiently transferred to the webview and will also be correctly recreated inside of the webview. |
    | **Returns**         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
    | `Thenable<boolean>` | A promise that resolves when the message is posted to a webview or when it is dropped because the message was not deliverable.  Returns `true` if the message was posted to the webview. Messages can only be posted to live webviews (i.e. either visible webviews or hidden webviews that set `retainContextWhenHidden`).  A response of `true` does not mean that the message was actually received by the webview. For example, no message listeners may be have been hooked up inside the webview or the webview may have been destroyed after the message was posted but before it was received.  If you want confirm that a message as actually received, you can try having your webview posting a confirmation message back to your extension.                                                                  |

### WebviewOptions

Content settings for a webview.

#### Properties

*   **`enableCommandUris?`**: `boolean` | `readonly string[]`
    Controls whether command uris are enabled in webview content or not.
    Defaults to `false` (command uris are disabled).
    If you pass in an array, only the commands in the array are allowed.
*   **`enableForms?`**: `boolean`
    Controls whether forms are enabled in the webview content or not.
    Defaults to `true` if scripts are enabled. Otherwise defaults to `false`. Explicitly setting this property to either `true` or `false` overrides the default.
*   **`enableScripts?`**: `boolean`
    Controls whether scripts are enabled in the webview content or not.
    Defaults to `false` (scripts-disabled).
*   **`localResourceRoots?`**: `readonly Uri[]`
    Root paths from which the webview can load local (filesystem) resources using uris from `asWebviewUri`
    Default to the root folders of the current workspace plus the extension's install directory.
    Pass in an empty array to disallow access to any local resources.
*   **`portMapping?`**: `readonly WebviewPortMapping[]`
    Mappings of `localhost` ports used inside the webview.
    Port mapping allow webviews to transparently define how `localhost` ports are resolved. This can be used to allow using a static `localhost` port inside the webview that is resolved to random port that a service is running on.
    If a webview accesses `localhost` content, we recommend that you specify port mappings even if the `webviewPort` and `extensionHostPort` ports are the same.
    Note that port mappings only work for `http` or `https` urls. Websocket urls (e.g. `ws://localhost:3000`) cannot be mapped to another port.

### WebviewPanel

A panel that contains a webview.

#### Events

*   **`onDidChangeViewState`**: `Event<WebviewPanelOnDidChangeViewStateEvent>`
    Fired when the panel's view state changes.
*   **`onDidDispose`**: `Event<void>`
    Fired when the panel is disposed.
    This may be because the user closed the panel or because `.dispose()` was called on it.
    Trying to use the panel after it has been disposed throws an exception.

#### Properties

*   **`active`**: `boolean`
    Whether the panel is active (focused by the user).
*   **`iconPath?`**: `Uri` | {`dark`: `Uri`, `light`: `Uri`}
    Icon for the panel shown in UI.
*   **`options`**: `WebviewPanelOptions`
    Content settings for the webview panel.
*   **`title`**: `string`
    Title of the panel shown in UI.
*   **`viewColumn`**: `ViewColumn`
    Editor position of the panel. This property is only set if the webview is in one of the editor view columns.
*   **`viewType`**: `string`
    Identifies the type of the webview panel, such as `'markdown.preview'`.
*   **`visible`**: `boolean`
    Whether the panel is visible.
*   **`webview`**: `Webview`
    Webview belonging to the panel.

#### Methods

*   **`dispose(): any`**
    Dispose of the webview panel.
    This closes the panel if it showing and disposes of the resources owned by the webview.
    Webview panels are also disposed when the user closes the webview panel. Both cases fire the `onDispose` event.

    | Parameter   | Description     |
    | :---------- | :-------------- |
    | **Returns** | **Description** |
    | `any`       |                 |

*   **`reveal(viewColumn?: ViewColumn, preserveFocus?: boolean): void`**
    Show the webview panel in a given column.
    A webview panel may only show in a single column at a time. If it is already showing, this method moves it to a new column.

    | Parameter               | Description                                                                                                 |
    | :---------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `viewColumn?`: `ViewColumn` | View column to show the panel in. Shows in the current `viewColumn` if `undefined`.                       |
    | `preserveFocus?`: `boolean` | When `true`, the webview will not take focus.                                                               |
    | **Returns**             | **Description**                                                                                             |
    | `void`                  |                                                                                                             |

### WebviewPanelOnDidChangeViewStateEvent

Event fired when a webview panel's view state changes.

#### Properties

*   **`webviewPanel`**: `WebviewPanel`
    Webview panel whose view state changed.

### WebviewPanelOptions

Content settings for a webview panel.

#### Properties

*   **`enableFindWidget?`**: `boolean`
    Controls if the find widget is enabled in the panel.
    Defaults to `false`.
*   **`retainContextWhenHidden?`**: `boolean`
    Controls if the webview panel's content (iframe) is kept around even when the panel is no longer visible.
    Normally the webview panel's html context is created when the panel becomes visible and destroyed when it is hidden. Extensions that have complex state or UI can set the `retainContextWhenHidden` to make the editor keep the webview context around, even when the webview moves to a background tab. When a webview using `retainContextWhenHidden` becomes hidden, its scripts and other dynamic content are suspended. When the panel becomes visible again, the context is automatically restored in the exact same state it was in originally. You cannot send messages to a hidden webview, even with `retainContextWhenHidden` enabled.
    `retainContextWhenHidden` has a high memory overhead and should only be used if your panel's context cannot be quickly saved and restored.

### WebviewPanelSerializer<T>

Restore webview panels that have been persisted when vscode shuts down.

There are two types of webview persistence:
*   Persistence within a session.
*   Persistence across sessions (across restarts of the editor).

A `WebviewPanelSerializer` is only required for the second case: persisting a webview across sessions.

Persistence within a session allows a webview to save its state when it becomes hidden and restore its content from this state when it becomes visible again. It is powered entirely by the webview content itself. To save off a persisted state, call `acquireVsCodeApi().setState()` with any json serializable object. To restore the state again, call `getState()`
```javascript
// Within the webview
const vscode = acquireVsCodeApi();

// Get existing state
const oldState = vscode.getState() || { value: 0 };

// Update state
setState({ value: oldState.value + 1 });
```
A `WebviewPanelSerializer` extends this persistence across restarts of the editor. When the editor is shutdown, it will save off the state from `setState` of all webviews that have a serializer. When the webview first becomes visible after the restart, this state is passed to `deserializeWebviewPanel`. The extension can then restore the old `WebviewPanel` from this state.

#### Methods

*   **`deserializeWebviewPanel(webviewPanel: WebviewPanel, state: T): Thenable<void>`**
    Restore a webview panel from its serialized state.
    Called when a serialized webview first becomes visible.

    | Parameter                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                    |
    | :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `webviewPanel`: `WebviewPanel` | Webview panel to restore. The serializer should take ownership of this panel. The serializer must restore the webview's `.html` and hook up all webview events.             |
    | `state`: `T`              | Persisted state from the webview content.                                                                                                                                      |
    | **Returns**               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                |
    | `Thenable<void>`          | Thenable indicating that the webview has been fully restored.                                                                                                                  |

### WebviewPortMapping

Defines a port mapping used for `localhost` inside the webview.

#### Properties

*   **`extensionHostPort`**: `number`
    Destination port. The `webviewPort` is resolved to this port.
*   **`webviewPort`**: `number`
    `localhost` port to remap inside the webview.

### WebviewView

A webview based view.

#### Events

*   **`onDidChangeVisibility`**: `Event<void>`
    Event fired when the visibility of the view changes.
    Actions that trigger a visibility change:
    *   The view is collapsed or expanded.
    *   The user switches to a different view group in the sidebar or panel.
    Note that hiding a view using the context menu instead disposes of the view and fires `onDidDispose`.
*   **`onDidDispose`**: `Event<void>`
    Event fired when the view is disposed.
    Views are disposed when they are explicitly hidden by a user (this happens when a user right clicks in a view and unchecks the webview view).
    Trying to use the view after it has been disposed throws an exception.

#### Properties

*   **`badge?`**: `ViewBadge`
    The badge to display for this webview view. To remove the badge, set to `undefined`.
*   **`description?`**: `string`
    Human-readable string which is rendered less prominently in the title.
*   **`title?`**: `string`
    View title displayed in the UI.
    The view title is initially taken from the extension `package.json` contribution.
*   **`viewType`**: `string`
    Identifies the type of the webview view, such as `'hexEditor.dataView'`.
*   **`visible`**: `boolean`
    Tracks if the webview is currently visible.
    Views are visible when they are on the screen and expanded.
*   **`webview`**: `Webview`
    The underlying webview for the view.

#### Methods

*   **`show(preserveFocus?: boolean): void`**
    Reveal the view in the UI.
    If the view is collapsed, this will expand it.

    | Parameter               | Description                                     |
    | :---------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
    | `preserveFocus?`: `boolean` | When `true` the view will not take focus.       |
    | **Returns**             | **Description**                                 |
    | `void`                  |                                                 |

### WebviewViewProvider

#### Methods

*   **`resolveWebviewView(webviewView: WebviewView, context: WebviewViewResolveContext<unknown>, token: CancellationToken): void | Thenable<void>`**
    Resolves a webview view.
    `resolveWebviewView` is called when a view first becomes visible. This may happen when the view is first loaded or when the user hides and then shows a view again.

    | Parameter                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                    |

    | `void` \| `Thenable<void>`                          | Optional thenable indicating that the view has been fully resolved.                                                                                                            |

### WebviewViewResolveContext<T>

Additional information the webview view being resolved.

#### Properties

*   **`state`**: `T`
    Persisted state from the webview content.
    To save resources, the editor normally deallocates webview documents (the iframe content) that are not visible. For example, when the user collapse a view or switches to another top level activity in the sidebar, the `WebviewView` itself is kept alive but the webview's underlying document is deallocated. It is recreated when the view becomes visible again.
    You can prevent this behavior by setting `retainContextWhenHidden` in the `WebviewOptions`. However this increases resource usage and should be avoided wherever possible. Instead, you can use persisted state to save off a webview's state so that it can be quickly recreated as needed.
    To save off a persisted state, inside the webview call `acquireVsCodeApi().setState()` with any json serializable object. To restore the state again, call `getState()`. For example:
    ```javascript
    // Within the webview
    const vscode = acquireVsCodeApi();

    // Get existing state
    const oldState = vscode.getState() || { value: 0 };

    // Update state
    setState({ value: oldState.value + 1 });
    ```
    The editor ensures that the persisted state is saved correctly when a webview is hidden and across editor restarts.

### WindowState

Represents the state of a window.

#### Properties

*   **`active`**: `boolean`
    Whether the window has been interacted with recently. This will change immediately on activity, or after a short time of user inactivity.
*   **`focused`**: `boolean`
    Whether the current window is focused.

### WorkspaceConfiguration

Represents the configuration. It is a merged view of
*   Default Settings
*   Global (User) Settings
*   Workspace settings
*   Workspace Folder settings - From one of the `WorkspaceFolder`s under which requested resource belongs to.
*   Language settings - Settings defined under requested language.

The effective value (returned by `get`) is computed by overriding or merging the values in the following order:
1.  `defaultValue` (if defined in `package.json` otherwise derived from the value's type)
2.  `globalValue` (if defined)
3.  `workspaceValue` (if defined)
4.  `workspaceFolderValue` (if defined)
5.  `defaultLanguageValue` (if defined)
6.  `globalLanguageValue` (if defined)
7.  `workspaceLanguageValue` (if defined)
8.  `workspaceFolderLanguageValue` (if defined)

Note: Only object value types are merged and all other value types are overridden.

Example 1: Overriding
```javascript
defaultValue = 'on';
globalValue = 'relative';
workspaceFolderValue = 'off';
value = 'off';
```
Example 2: Language Values
```javascript
defaultValue = 'on';
globalValue = 'relative';
workspaceFolderValue = 'off';
globalLanguageValue = 'on';
value = 'on';
```
Example 3: Object Values
```javascript
defaultValue = { a: 1, b: 2 };
globalValue = { b: 3, c: 4 };
value = { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 };
```
Note: Workspace and Workspace Folder configurations contains `launch` and `tasks` settings. Their basename will be part of the section identifier. The following snippets shows how to retrieve all configurations from `launch.json`:
```javascript
// launch.json configuration
const config = workspace.getConfiguration( 'launch', vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders[0].uri );

// retrieve values
const values = config.get('configurations');
```
Refer to [Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) for more information.

### WorkspaceEditEntryMetadata

Additional data for entries of a workspace edit. Supports to label entries and marks entries as needing confirmation by the user. The editor groups edits with equal labels into tree nodes, for instance all edits labelled with "Changes in Strings" would be a tree node.

#### Properties

*   **`description?`**: `string`
    A human-readable string which is rendered less prominent on the same line.
*   **`iconPath?`**: `IconPath`
    The icon path or `ThemeIcon` for the edit.
*   **`label`**: `string`
    A human-readable string which is rendered prominent.
*   **`needsConfirmation`**: `boolean`
    A flag which indicates that user confirmation is needed.

### WorkspaceEditMetadata

Additional data about a workspace edit.

#### Properties

*   **`isRefactoring?`**: `boolean`
    Signal to the editor that this edit is a refactoring.

### WorkspaceFolder

A workspace folder is one of potentially many roots opened by the editor. All workspace folders are equal which means there is no notion of an active or primary workspace folder.

#### Properties

*   **`index`**: `number`
    The ordinal number of this workspace folder.
*   **`name`**: `string`
    The name of this workspace folder. Defaults to the basename of its `uri`-path
*   **`uri`**: `Uri`
    The associated uri for this workspace folder.
    Note: The `Uri`-type was intentionally chosen such that future releases of the editor can support workspace folders that are not stored on the local disk, e.g. `ftp://server/workspaces/foo`.

### WorkspaceFolderPickOptions

Options to configure the behaviour of the workspace folder pick UI.

#### Properties

*   **`ignoreFocusOut?`**: `boolean`
    Set to `true` to keep the picker open when focus moves to another part of the editor or to another window. This setting is ignored on iPad and is always `false`.
*   **`placeHolder?`**: `string`
    An optional string to show as placeholder in the input box to guide the user what to pick on.

### WorkspaceFoldersChangeEvent

An event describing a change to the set of workspace folders.

#### Properties

*   **`added`**: `readonly WorkspaceFolder[]`
    Added workspace folders.
*   **`removed`**: `readonly WorkspaceFolder[]`
    Removed workspace folders.

### WorkspaceSymbolProvider<T>

The workspace symbol provider interface defines the contract between extensions and the symbol search-feature.

#### Methods

*   **`provideWorkspaceSymbols(query: string, token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<T[]>`**
    Project-wide search for a symbol matching the given query string.
    The `query`-parameter should be interpreted in a relaxed way as the editor will apply its own highlighting and scoring on the results. A good rule of thumb is to match case-insensitive and to simply check that the characters of `query` appear in their order in a candidate symbol. Don't use prefix, substring, or similar strict matching.
    To improve performance implementors can implement `resolveWorkspaceSymbol` and then provide symbols with partial `location`-objects, without a range defined. The editor will then call `resolveWorkspaceSymbol` for selected symbols only, e.g. when opening a workspace symbol.

    | Parameter                     | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
    | :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | `query`: `string`             | A query string, can be the empty string in which case all symbols should be returned.                                                                         |
    | `token`: `CancellationToken`  | A cancellation token.                                                                                                                                         |
    | **Returns**                   | **Description**                                                                                                                                               |
    | `ProviderResult<T[]>`         | An array of document highlights or a thenable that resolves to such. The lack of a result can be signaled by returning `undefined`, `null`, or an empty array. |

*   **`resolveWorkspaceSymbol(symbol: T, token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<T>`**
    Given a symbol fill in its `location`. This method is called whenever a symbol is selected in the UI. Providers can implement this method and return incomplete symbols from `provideWorkspaceSymbols` which often helps to improve performance.

    | Parameter                    | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
    | :--------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `symbol`: `T`                | The symbol that is to be resolved. Guaranteed to be an instance of an object returned from an earlier call to `provideWorkspaceSymbols`.                    |
    | `token`: `CancellationToken` | A cancellation token.                                                                                                                                        |
    | **Returns**                  | **Description**                                                                                                                                              |
    | `ProviderResult<T>`          | The resolved symbol or a thenable that resolves to that. When no result is returned, the given symbol is used.                                                |
