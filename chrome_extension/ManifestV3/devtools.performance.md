## Description

Use the `chrome.devtools.performance` API to listen to recording status updates in the Performance panel in DevTools.

See DevTools APIs summary for general introduction to using Developer Tools APIs.

## Availability

Chrome 129+

Starting from Chrome 128, you can listen to notifications of the recording status of the Performance panel.

## Concepts and usage

The `chrome.devtools.performance` API allows developers to interact with the recording features of the Performance panel panel in Chrome DevTools. You can use this API to get notifications when recording starts or stops.

Two events are available:

*   `onProfilingStarted`: This event is fired when the Performance panel begins recording performance data.
*   `onProfilingStopped`: This event is fired when the Performance panel stops recording performance data.

Both events don't have any associated parameters.

By listening to these events, developers can create extensions that react to the recording status in the Performance panel, providing additional automation during performance profiling.

## Examples

This is how you can use the API to listen to recording status updates

```javascript
chrome.devtools.performance.onProfilingStarted.addListener(() => {
  // Profiling started listener implementation
});
chrome.devtools.performance.onProfilingStopped.addListener(() => {
  // Profiling stopped listener implementation
})
```

## Events

### onProfilingStarted

```javascript
chrome.devtools.performance.onProfilingStarted.addListener(
  callback: function,
)
```

Fired when the Performance panel starts recording.

#### Parameters

*   `callback`

    `function`

    The callback parameter looks like:

    ```javascript
    () => void
    ```

### onProfilingStopped

```javascript
chrome.devtools.performance.onProfilingStopped.addListener(
  callback: function,
)
```

Fired when the Performance panel stops recording.

#### Parameters

*   `callback`

    `function`

    The callback parameter looks like:

    ```javascript
    () => void
    ```
