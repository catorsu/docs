# chrome.action

## Description

Use the `chrome.action` API to control the extension's icon in the Google Chrome toolbar.

The action icons are displayed in the browser toolbar next to the omnibox. After installation, these appear in the extensions menu (the puzzle piece icon). Users can pin your extension icon to the toolbar.

## Availability

Chrome 88+ MV3+

## Manifest

The following keys must be declared in the manifest to use this API.

`"action"`

To use the `chrome.action` API, specify a `manifest_version` of 3 and include the `"action"` key in your manifest file.

Note: Every extension has an icon in the Chrome toolbar, even if the `"action"` key isn't added to the manifest.

```json
{
  "name": "Action Extension",
  ...
  "action": {
    "default_icon": { // optional
      "16": "images/icon16.png", // optional
      "24": "images/icon24.png", // optional
      "32": "images/icon32.png"  // optional
    },
    "default_title": "Click Me", // optional, shown in tooltip
    "default_popup": "popup.html" // optional
  },
  ...
}
```

The `"action"` key (along with its children) is optional. When it isn't included, your extension is still shown in the toolbar to provide access to the extension's menu. For this reason, we recommend that you always include at least the `"action"` and `"default_icon"` keys.

## Concepts and usage

### Icon

The icon is the main image on the toolbar for your extension, and is set by the `"default_icon"` key in your manifest's `"action"` key. Icons must be 16 device-independent pixels (DIPs) wide and tall.

The `"default_icon"` key is a dictionary of sizes to image paths. Chrome uses these icons to choose which image scale to use. If an exact match is not found, Chrome selects the closest available and scales it to fit the image, which might affect image quality.

Because devices with less-common scale factors like 1.5x or 1.2x are becoming more common, we encourage you to provide multiple sizes for your icons. This also futureproofs your extension against potential icon display size changes. However, if only providing a single size, the `"default_icon"` key can also be set to a string with the path to a single icon instead of a dictionary.

You can also call `action.setIcon()` to set your extension's icon programmatically by specifying a different image path or providing a dynamically-generated icon using the HTML `canvas` element, or, if setting from an extension service worker, the `offscreen` canvas API.

```javascript
const canvas = new OffscreenCanvas(16, 16);
const context = canvas.getContext('2d');
context.clearRect(0, 0, 16, 16);
context.fillStyle = '#00FF00'; // Green
context.fillRect(0, 0, 16, 16);
const imageData = context.getImageData(0, 0, 16, 16);
chrome.action.setIcon({imageData: imageData}, () => { /* ... */ });
```

Note: The `action.setIcon()` API is intended to set a static image. Don't use animated images for your icons.

For packed extensions (installed from a `.crx` file), images can be in most formats that the Blink rendering engine can display, including `PNG`, `JPEG`, `BMP`, `ICO`, and others. `SVG` isn't supported. Unpacked extensions must use `PNG` images.

### Tooltip (title)

The tooltip, or title, appears when the user holds their mouse pointer over the extension's icon in the toolbar. It's also included in the accessible text spoken by screen readers when the button gets focus.

The default tooltip is set using the `"default_title"` field of the `"action"` key in `manifest.json`. You can also set it programmatically by calling `action.setTitle()`.

### Badge

Actions can optionally display a "badge" — a bit of text layered over the icon. This lets you update the action to display a small amount of information about the state of the extension, such as a counter. The badge has a text component and a background color. Because space is limited, we recommend that badge text use four or fewer characters.

To create a badge, set it programmatically by calling `action.setBadgeBackgroundColor()` and `action.setBadgeText()`. There isn't a default badge setting in the manifest. Badge color values can be either an array of four integers between 0 and 255 that make up the RGBA color of the badge or a string with a CSS color value.

```javascript
chrome.action.setBadgeBackgroundColor(
  {color: [0, 255, 0, 0]}, // Green
  () => { /* ... */ },
);
chrome.action.setBadgeBackgroundColor(
  {color: '#00FF00'}, // Also green
  () => { /* ... */ },
);
chrome.action.setBadgeBackgroundColor(
  {color: 'green'}, // Also, also green
  () => { /* ... */ },
);
```

### Popup

An action's popup is shown when the user clicks on the extension's action button in the toolbar. The popup can contain any HTML contents you like, and will be automatically sized to fit its contents. The popup's size must be between 25x25 and 800x600 pixels.

The popup is initially set by the `"default_popup"` property in the `"action"` key in the `manifest.json` file. If present, this property should point to a relative path within the extension directory. It can also be updated dynamically to point to a different relative path using the `action.setPopup()` method.

Note: The `action.onClicked` event won't be sent if the extension action has specified a popup to show on click of the current tab.

## Use cases

### Per-tab state

Extension actions can have different states for each tab. To set a value for an individual tab, use the `tabId` property in the `action` API's setting methods. For example, to set the badge text for a specific tab, do something like the following:

```javascript
function getTabId() { /* ... */}
function getTabBadge() { /* ... */}
chrome.action.setBadgeText(
  {
    text: getTabBadge(tabId),
    tabId: getTabId(),
  },
  () => { ... }
);
```

If the `tabId` property is left out, the setting is treated as a global setting. Tab-specific settings take priority over global settings.

### Enabled state

By default, toolbar actions are enabled (clickable) on every tab. You can change this default by setting the `default_state` property in the `action` key of the manifest. If `default_state` is set to `"disabled"`, the action is disabled by default and must be enabled programmatically to be clickable. If `default_state` is set to `"enabled"` (the default), the action is enabled and clickable by default.

You can control the state programmatically using the `action.enable()` and `action.disable()` methods. This only affects whether the popup (if any) or `action.onClicked` event is sent to your extension; it doesn't affect the action's presence in the toolbar.

## Examples

The following examples show some common ways that actions are used in extensions. To try this API, install the Action API example from the chrome-extension-samples repository.

### Show a popup

It's common for an extension to display a popup when the user clicks the extension's action. To implement this in your own extension, declare the popup in your `manifest.json` and specify the content that Chrome should display in the popup.

```json
// manifest.json
{
  "name": "Action popup demo",
  "version": "1.0",
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "action": {
    "default_title": "Click to view a popup",
    "default_popup": "popup.html"
  }
}
```

```html
<!-- popup.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    html {
      min-height: 5em;
      min-width: 10em;
      background: salmon;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Hello, world!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Inject a content script on click

A common pattern for extensions is to expose their primary feature using the extension's action. The following example demonstrates this pattern. When the user clicks the action, the extension injects a content script into the current page. The content script then displays an alert to verify that everything worked as expected.

```json
// manifest.json
{
  "name": "Action script injection demo",
  "version": "1.0",
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "action": {
    "default_title": "Click to show an alert"
  },
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "scripting"],
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  }
}
```

```javascript
// background.js
chrome.action.onClicked.addListener((tab) => {
  chrome.scripting.executeScript({
    target: {tabId: tab.id},
    files: ['content.js']
  });
});
```

```javascript
// content.js
alert('Hello, world!');
```

### Emulate actions with declarativeContent

This example shows how an extension's background logic can (a) disable an action by default and (b) use `declarativeContent` to enable the action on specific sites.

```javascript
// service-worker.js
// Wrap in an onInstalled callback to avoid unnecessary work
// every time the service worker is run
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
  // Page actions are disabled by default and enabled on select tabs
  chrome.action.disable();

  // Clear all rules to ensure only our expected rules are set
  chrome.declarativeContent.onPageChanged.removeRules(undefined, () => {
    // Declare a rule to enable the action on example.com pages
    let exampleRule = {
      conditions: [
        new chrome.declarativeContent.PageStateMatcher({
          pageUrl: {hostSuffix: '.example.com'},
        })
      ],
      actions: [new chrome.declarativeContent.ShowAction()],
    };

    // Finally, apply our new array of rules
    let rules = [exampleRule];
    chrome.declarativeContent.onPageChanged.addRules(rules);
  });
});
```

### `setIcon()`

Promise

```javascript

#### Parameters

*   `details`
    `object`
    *   `imageData`
        `ImageData | object` optional
        Either an `ImageData` object or a dictionary `{size -> ImageData}` representing icon to be set. If the icon is specified as a dictionary, the actual image to be used is chosen depending on screen's pixel density. If the number of image pixels that fit into one screen space unit equals `scale`, then image with size `scale * n` will be selected, where `n` is the size of the icon in the UI. At least one image must be specified. Note that `'details.imageData = foo'` is equivalent to `'details.imageData = {'16': foo}'`
    *   `path`
        `string | object` optional
        Either a relative image path or a dictionary `{size -> relative image path}` pointing to icon to be set. If the icon is specified as a dictionary, the actual image to be used is chosen depending on screen's pixel density. If the number of image pixels that fit into one screen space unit equals `scale`, then image with size `scale * n` will be selected, where `n` is the size of the icon in the UI.
