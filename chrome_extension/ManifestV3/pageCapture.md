# `chrome.pageCapture`

## Description

Use the `chrome.pageCapture` API to save a tab as MHTML.

MHTML is a standard format supported by most browsers. It encapsulates in a single file a page and all its resources (CSS files, images..).

Note that for security reasons a MHTML file can only be loaded from the file system and that it can only be loaded in the main frame.

## Permissions

`pageCapture`

You must declare the `"pageCapture"` permission in the extension manifest to use the `pageCapture` API. For example:

```
{ "name": "My extension", ... "permissions": [ "pageCapture" ], ... }
```

## Methods

### `saveAsMHTML()`

`Promise`

```
chrome.pageCapture.saveAsMHTML( details: object, callback?: function, )
```

Saves the content of the tab with given id as MHTML.

#### Parameters

*   `details`: `object`

    *   `tabId`: `number`

        The id of the tab to save as MHTML.
*   `callback`: `function optional`

    The callback parameter looks like:

    ```
    (mhtmlData?: Blob) => void
    ```

    *   `mhtmlData`: `Blob optional`

        The MHTML data as a `Blob`.

#### Returns

*   `Promise<Blob | undefined>`: Chrome 116+

    Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
